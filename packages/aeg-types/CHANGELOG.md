## 0.8.2

### Patch Changes

- 9d730e1: Fix the `doc-coverage` check so an applied `vinaya/waiver:docs` label actually takes effect. It previously read `PR_LABELS`/`WAIVER_LABEL_ACTOR` from the environment, expecting the CI workflow to inject them — but no generated `vinaya-checks.yml`, old or current, ever set either var, so the waiver path was silently unreachable in every adopter's CI (caught live on atta-labs/attalabs#948). The check now resolves the label and its labeling actor live via `gh`, from `PR_NUMBER`, the same way `review-gate` already does — no workflow template change needed, and every already-generated `vinaya-checks.yml` is fixed in place.

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- 30dc300: Recognize a hand-closed dependency Issue as valid when it was closed directly by a recognized Principal identity (verified via GitHub's own `ClosedEvent` actor, not claimed in prose), instead of only accepting a merged closing PR. `dispatch-gate` and `coherence` check A1 both gain this second, narrower recognition path — the default merged-PR path is unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- 334c9d4: The four engine packages are now publicly published: `private: true` dropped, `publishConfig.access: "public"` added, and `.changeset/config.json`'s `privatePackages.tag` flipped to `true`. First public versions of `@atta/aeg-core`, `@atta/aeg-types`, `@atta/aeg-forge-state` and `@atta/vinaya-sources` ship on the next `changeset publish`, alongside `@attalabs/vinaya` as the same fixed-group version.
