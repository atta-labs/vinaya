/**
 * labels.ts — the canonical, code-owned enumeration of every Vinaya label that
 * carries meaning to the mechanism. Pure data, zero I/O, zero imports beyond
 * its own types — the same discipline as `actions.ts` and `waiver-label.ts`
 * (one pure-data list, read by both the logic and the rendered docs, so the
 * two can never drift).
 *
 * ## The `vinaya/` namespace
 *
 * Every label the mechanism reads lives under the `vinaya/` product namespace.
 * The grammar is three separators, each with one job:
 *
 *   - `/` separates the **product** from everything it owns — `vinaya/…`
 *   - `:` separates the **namespace** from its value — `vinaya/tier:1`
 *   - `-` separates the **words** inside a name — `vinaya/needs:brief-correction`
 *
 * So `vinaya/tranche:state-machine-v1` reads as: the Vinaya product, the
 * `tranche` axis, the `state-machine-v1` value. The namespace makes every
 * Vinaya label sortable and filterable as one group in a repo it shares with
 * an adopter's own labels — the reason a product namespace exists at all.
 * The `aeg` name is retired in public, so no `aeg:*` label survives:
 * `aeg:blocked` became `vinaya/blocked`, and the forge's `aeg:incoherent` /
 * `aeg:stale-blocker` were renamed in place (history preserved).
 *
 * GitHub caps a label name at 50 characters. `vinaya/tranche:` spends 15 of
 * them before the slug starts — `trancheSlugLengthError` is the check that
 * keeps a Planner from cutting a slug the forge cannot hold.
 *
 * ## Why it lives here
 *
 * It lives in `@atta/aeg-forge-state`, not `@atta/aeg-core`, because the
 * dependency direction is `aeg-core → aeg-forge-state → aeg-types`: the
 * vocabulary's first consumer is `map-forge-facts.ts` (the mapper that turns
 * a raw GitHub label list into the `blockedLabel` fact), which sits in this
 * package and cannot import backward from `aeg-core`. This is the lowest
 * package every consumer already depends on. `@atta/aeg-core` re-exports the
 * whole helper surface, so consumers that only depend on `aeg-core` (the
 * Vinaya CLI) reach the same single source without a new dependency.
 *
 * ## The helpers are the contract
 *
 * No call site may write a label string as a literal. `label()`,
 * `trancheLabel()`, `matchesLabel()` and `trancheSlugOf()` are the only
 * sanctioned ways to construct or match one — a stray literal is a site the
 * next rename will silently miss, and a missed site is a broken gate.
 *
 * Each entry records the *orthogonal fact* the label carries — the one thing
 * the mechanism learns from its presence. Labels are orthogonal by design:
 * a task's tier, its tranche, what it is waiting on, and what has been
 * waived are independent axes, and no code should infer one from another.
 *
 * **Status is not in here, and must never be.** Execution status is derived
 * from forge objects (`state-machine-model.ts`), never written
 * as a label — a `status:*` label would recreate the racing status store the
 * derivation model exists to eliminate. **Project is not in here either**: a
 * task's project is a `**Project:**` field in its Issue body, never a label.
