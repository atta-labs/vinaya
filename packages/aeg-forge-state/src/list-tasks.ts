 * keeps project resolution working after those labels are removed, and gives a
 * forge-native task Issue that carries only the field — never got a label — a
 * resolvable project today (the `state-machine-v1` dead-board case). Matches the
 * bold field line only; the prose `**Project(s) + blast radius**` heading and a
 * backticked inline `Project: x` never match (no `:**` immediately after).
 *
 * Values are shape-guarded, not registry-checked: the field is free prose and
 * authors write real sentences in it (#554: `**Project:** (none — tools/admin
 * is unregistered; …)`), which without a guard becomes a "project" that builds
 * a 404 board link — strictly worse than the board-less row it replaces. The
 * guard stays a slug shape rather than a registry lookup on purpose: this
 * package is pure, repo-parameterized forge derivation and must not couple to
 * `packages/governance`. An unregistered-but-slug-shaped value still resolves
 * here; that is the registry's problem to report, not this parser's. */
