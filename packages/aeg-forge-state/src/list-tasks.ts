 * only source. It also resolves a forge-native task Issue that carries only the
 * field and never got a label (the `state-machine-v1` dead-board case). Matches
 * the bold field line only; the prose `**Project(s) + blast radius**` heading
 * and a backticked inline `Project: x` never match (no `:**` right after).
 *
 * Values are shape-guarded, not registry-checked: the field is free prose and
 * authors write real sentences in it (#554: `**Project:** (none — tools/admin
 * is unregistered; …)`), which without a guard becomes a "project" that builds
 * a 404 board link — strictly worse than the board-less row it replaces. The
 * guard stays a slug shape rather than a registry lookup on purpose: this
 * package is pure, repo-parameterized forge derivation and must not couple to
 * `.vinaya`. An unregistered-but-slug-shaped value still resolves
 * here; that is the registry's problem to report, not this parser's. */

 * the `aeg-forge-state-v1` fixture). Accepting only the bold form made this
 * parser disagree with `issue-validation.ts`'s `declaredProjects`, which has
 * always been tolerant — and once #614 deleted the `project:*` labels, that
 * disagreement silently dropped the project of every plain-form Issue.
 *
 * The optional `**` are matched independently on each side rather than as a
 * required pair, which is what keeps the prose heading `**Project(s) + blast
