/**
 * actions.ts — the canonical, aeg-core-owned enumeration of every AEG action
 * that either crosses into GitHub or hands work across a role-seam contract.
 * Pure data, zero I/O, zero imports beyond the type itself — same discipline
 * as `waiver-label.ts`.
 *
 * Two consumers read this one list (Issue #505): G3's "no seventh way into
 * GitHub" completeness story (`registry-checks.ts`) targets the
 * `crosses: 'into-github'` subset against `enforcement.md`'s Ring-0 gate rows;
 * task 506's DiagramModel places each action both inside a ring-0 gate (as a
 * guarded crossing) and on the edge between role/contract nodes (as a seam
 * hand-off). One list, so an `ACTIONS.length`-driven diagram edge count and
 * G3's crossing list can never drift apart.
 *
 * The set is 10 distinct actions, not 12: the 6 crossings named in Issue #505
 * plus 4 seam-only actions. Two of the six contract seams are already
 * accomplished by a GitHub crossing (the Planner→Brief seam's carrier is the
 * Issue body, created by `create-a-task-issue`; the Developer→Reviewer seam's
 * carrier is the PR, created by `open-a-pull-request`), so they get no
 * duplicate id — inventing one would give two ids for one real act and break
 * any `ACTIONS.length`-driven edge count.
 *
 * `crosses` is factually per-action, not a mirror of Issue #505's prose:
 * `commit-the-work` is `'none'` because `git commit` never leaves the local
 * machine — it is `git push` (`publish-the-branch`) that reaches the
 * GitHub-hosted remote. `enforcement.md`'s own Ring-0 table lists them as
 * separate rows (`.husky/pre-commit` vs `.husky/pre-push`) for exactly this
 * reason..
 *
 * The only valid `performedBy` values are the 9 `role_id`s under
 * `aeg-root/roles/*.md` (task 2, #522) — asserted by the real-file test.

// the raw-API gate — both reference pull requests. See PR body.
//
// Consumed by both `actions.test.ts` (the crossing tripwire) and

// can never drift between them (same no-drift principle as ACTIONS).
