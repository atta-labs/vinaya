/**
 * The doctrine sweep, as a check instead of a habit.
 *
 * Five review rounds each declared the decision-log claim swept, and each time
 * it resurfaced a few lines from where the previous pass fixed it — usually in
 * a more authoritative document than the last. That is the signature of a rule
 * enforced by attention rather than by a gate, which is the exact failure this
 * whole change exists to end. So: the rule gets a gate.
 *
 * A retired mechanism must not be described as live anywhere an agent reads.
 * `EXEMPT` is the honest, enumerated list of places a mention is legitimate —
 * frozen archives, historical records, and this file. Anything else is a
 * failure with the file and line printed.
 *
 * A second, related class joined this suite later: `RETIRED_IN_PRODUCT` also
 * bans a forge number (`#294`) and an internal tranche slug
 * (`aeg-forge-state-v1`) cited bare in the doctrine `aeg-root/**` publishes.
 * Neither is retired — both are the product's live vocabulary — but citing
 * one as an unexplained doctrine reference is exactly the residue the ruling
 * that ended the decision log already named: "a decision id, a retired
 * mechanism's vocabulary, an internal tranche slug — none of it means
 * anything to someone who was not here, and a tool meant to be adopted
 * cannot ship the residue of the monorepo it grew in." That ruling's
 * enforcement covered `D-###` and stopped; forge numbers and slugs survived
 * unwatched until this pair of patterns closed the gap. Both are scoped to
 * `aeg-root` only via `PATTERN_SCOPE`, not the full `PRODUCT` surface — see
 * the comment on `PATTERN_SCOPE` for why a repo-wide ban would be wrong for
 * this specific class, unlike the ones above it.
 *
 * A third failure mode, found by post-merge review, joined coverage to
 * vacuity: `[a-z][a-z-]+-v[0-9]` only sees a tranche slug that ends `-vN`.
 * Four of this repo's own archived tranches — `aeg-governance-hardening`,
 * `aeg-consolidation`, `aeg-studio-cleanup`, `herald-onto-engine` — predate
 * that suffix convention, and the shape-based pattern is structurally blind
 * to them; its self-guard sample (`aeg-coherence-v1`) happened to be drawn
 * from the class the pattern already covers, so it proved non-vacuity
 * without ever proving coverage. `LEGACY_SLUG_PATTERN` below closes that:
 * derived from `aeg-root/tranches/completed/*.md` filenames — the
 * authoritative list of what a real slug looks like — instead of a
 * hand-shaped regex guess, so it cannot drift from reality the way the
 * `-vN` guess did.
