/**
 * The doctrine sweep, as a check instead of a habit.
 *
 * Five review rounds each declared the decision-log claim swept, and each time
 * it resurfaced a few lines from where the previous pass fixed it — usually in
 * a more authoritative document than the last. That is the signature of a rule
 * enforced by attention rather than by a gate, which is the exact failure this
 * whole change exists to end. So: the rule gets a gate.
 *
 * A retired mechanism must not be described as live anywhere an agent reads.
 * `EXEMPT` is the honest, enumerated list of places a mention is legitimate —
 * frozen archives, historical records, and this file. Anything else is a
 * failure with the file and line printed.
 *
 * A second, related class joined this suite later: `RETIRED_IN_PRODUCT` also
 * bans a forge number (`#294`) and an internal tranche slug
 * (`aeg-forge-state-v1`) cited bare in the doctrine `aeg-root/**` publishes.
 * Neither is retired — both are the product's live vocabulary — but citing
 * one as an unexplained doctrine reference is exactly the residue the ruling
 * that ended the decision log already named: "a decision id, a retired
 * mechanism's vocabulary, an internal tranche slug — none of it means
 * anything to someone who was not here, and a tool meant to be adopted
 * cannot ship the residue of the monorepo it grew in." That ruling's
 * enforcement covered `D-###` and stopped; forge numbers and slugs survived
 * unwatched until this pair of patterns closed the gap. `FORGE_NUMBER_PATTERN`
 * and `LEGACY_SLUG_PATTERN` are scoped to `aeg-root` only via `PATTERN_SCOPE`
 * — that directory is pure doctrine prose, no test fixtures, so a blind grep
 * there cannot mistake a legitimate occurrence for a citation.
 * `TRANCHE_SLUG_VN_PATTERN` needed a wider net (a real citation surfaced in
 * shipped `apps/vinaya/cli/src` comments, not doctrine), but not the full
 * `PRODUCT` surface: widening it to every path once flooded with hundreds of
 * false positives — `aeg-core`/`aeg-forge-state`'s own test fixtures
 * legitimately using real tranche names as data, and other products' entirely
 * unrelated `-vN` naming (Vāda's `crucible-v1.yaml`). See the comment on
 * `PATTERN_SCOPE` for the resulting hand-picked surface.
 *
 * A third failure mode, found by post-merge review, joined coverage to
 * vacuity: `[a-z][a-z-]+-v[0-9]` only sees a tranche slug that ends `-vN`.
 * Four of this repo's own archived tranches — `aeg-governance-hardening`,
 * `aeg-consolidation`, `aeg-studio-cleanup`, `herald-onto-engine` — predate
 * that suffix convention, and the shape-based pattern is structurally blind
 * to them; its self-guard sample (`aeg-coherence-v1`) happened to be drawn
 * from the class the pattern already covers, so it proved non-vacuity
 * without ever proving coverage. `LEGACY_SLUG_PATTERN` below closes that:
 * derived from `aeg-root/tranches/completed/*.md` filenames — the
 * authoritative list of what a real slug looks like — instead of a
 * hand-shaped regex guess, so it cannot drift from reality the way the
 * `-vN` guess did.

/**
 * Scopes a `RETIRED_IN_PRODUCT` pattern narrower than the full `PRODUCT`
 * surface. Unlike `D-###`/`decision log` — genuinely retired concepts that
 * appear nowhere live — a forge number or tranche slug is the product's own
 * working vocabulary: it appears legitimately in fixtures, tests, and
 * source across every `PRODUCT` path. What's banned is narrower than the
 * string: citing one as an unexplained doctrine reference.
 *
 * `FORGE_NUMBER_PATTERN` and `LEGACY_SLUG_PATTERN` scope to `aeg-root` only
 * — pure doctrine prose, no test fixtures live there, so a blind grep can't
 * mistake a legitimate occurrence for a citation.
 *
 * `TRANCHE_SLUG_VN_PATTERN` needs a second surface: the real incident this
 * pattern exists to catch was a citation in shipped `apps/vinaya/cli/src`
 * comments, not doctrine. It stays narrow, not `PRODUCT`-wide — first tried
 * at `['.']`, which produced ~600 false positives (aeg-core/aeg-forge-state's
 * own test fixtures using real tranche names as data, plus other products'
 * unrelated `-vN` naming like Vāda's `crucible-v1.yaml`) once the grep
 * buffer bug that had been silently swallowing that flood as "no hits" got
 * fixed. `apps/vinaya/cli/src` only, not `cli/tests` — the fixtures there
 * are the same legitimate-data case aeg-core's own tests are.
 *
 * This does not contradict `PRODUCT`'s own "an enumerated list is a
 * blind spot" argument above — it is a different scoping problem, not
 * the same one solved differently. `D-###`/`decision log` are dead
 * vocabulary with no legitimate positive occurrence anywhere, so
 * `PRODUCT = ['.']` costs nothing to keep repo-wide. A tranche slug is
 * the product's own live naming, colliding with real fixtures and other
 * products' unrelated conventions everywhere outside doctrine — going
 * repo-wide there isn't "a list that might miss a future path," it's
 * "a list that is mostly wrong right now." Known, deliberately
 * out-of-surface consequence: this scope does not yet reach Herald's
 * or `packages/agents/`'s own source comments (e.g.
 * `packages/agents/forensic-hiring-auditor/src/tools/github-signals.ts`,
 * `apps/herald-ai/web/src/components/HeraldAccountMenu.tsx`,
 * `apps/herald-ai/web/src/components/envoy/ReportView.tsx`), which
 * still carry live tranche-slug citations today — tracked as its own
 * follow-up, #736 (widen to Herald/Vāda/attalabs the same way this
