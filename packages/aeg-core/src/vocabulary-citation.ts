/**
 * vocabulary-citation.ts — a generic, regex-parameterized citation checker.
 *
 * `retired-vocabulary.test.ts` hand-rolls this exact sweep shape (pattern +
 * scope + exemptions + a non-vacuity self-test) for this repo's own internal
 * use, but as a `vitest` file no adopter can install it — and it hardcodes
 * every pattern, scope and exemption as a repo-specific literal. This module
 * generalizes the sweep into a reusable primitive: every pattern, its scope,
 * its exemptions, and the sample that proves it is not vacuous arrive as
 * caller-supplied input. It contains no product name, host-tool path, or
 * any other repo-specific literal — that knowledge belongs to whoever
 * configures an instance (a Vinaya check bin is one such consumer).
 *
 * Pure — no `fs`, no child-process I/O. The caller injects `grepFn`/
 * `matchFn`, mirroring `evaluateC5`'s `fileExists` injection in
 * `doc-owners.ts`: this file decides what counts as a finding, the I/O shim
 * decides how to look.
