/**
 * local-anchor-coverage.ts — a generic, regex-parameterized "dangling
 * anchor" checker.
 *
 * The pattern this generalizes: `reader-resolvable-prose.ts`'s Class 1
 * (`checkUnresolvableReferences`) flags a reference a reader cannot resolve
 * at all — the pattern (a forge number, a tranche slug) IS the finding, full
 * stop. This module handles the one-step-further case Issue #730 names: a
 * reference that is FINE as long as something else nearby resolves it — an
 * ordinal task mention ("Task 2") is fine beside a citation shaped
 * `(task N, #issue)`, and only a finding when that citation is missing from
 * its scope. Same "pattern is an input, not a constant" discipline as
 * `reader-resolvable-prose.ts`, carried one step further: the CITATION
 * pattern and its co-occurrence SCOPE are inputs too. This file has no
 * `/Task \d+/` literal, no citation-shape regex, no product name — that
 * knowledge belongs to whoever configures an instance (see
 * `scripts/vinaya-checks/task-anchor.ts` for attalabs' own).
 *
 * Zero I/O: mirrors `reader-resolvable-prose.ts`'s in-memory-content shape
 * (`files: { path, content }[]`, adapter-read) rather than
 * `vocabulary-citation.ts`'s `grepFn`/`matchFn` injection. Reason: co-occurrence
 * scoping (§ below) needs the whole file's line structure to group lines into
 * blocks — a per-line grep-hit model would force the adapter to pre-chunk
 * paragraphs itself before calling in, which is exactly the structural work
 * this primitive exists to own.
 *
 * `pattern`/`mustCoOccurWith` are real `RegExp` objects, not POSIX-ERE
 * strings — unlike `vocabulary-citation.ts`, nothing here shells out to
 * `grep -E`, so the `\d`/`\w`/`\s`-avoidance caution that applies there (GNU
 * grep reads those as literal characters) does not apply to this file; native
 * `RegExp` supports them. A consumer that itself uses `grep` for file
 * discovery (as `task-anchor.ts` does not — it reads files directly) would
 * still need that caution on its own end, independent of this primitive.
