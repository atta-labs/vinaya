/**
 * C7 — the published-prose check. Pure and zero-I/O, shaped like
 * `docs-coherence.ts` (parsed entries plus the model-backed surfaced-path
 * allowlist in, `{ errors, notes }` out).
 *
 * A role or contract doc is read by two audiences with opposite needs: an
 * agent taking the role reads it end to end as its operating instruction, and
 * a person landing on `/docs/roles/<id>` reads the same file cold. The answer
 * is one short, binding section at the top of every role and contract — `##
 * The short version` — which is what publishes; everything under `##
 * Reference` explains it and stays in the repo. This check enforces two
 * properties of that section, over the published set only:
 *
 *   1. **Structure** — every surfaced `roles/*.md` and `contracts/*.md` opens
 *      with a `## The short version` section carrying all four bold-led
 *      blocks, in order, inside the word band. The blocks answer the same four
 *      questions for a role and for a seam (what it owns/carries, when it
 *      refuses, what it never does, how it physically runs), which is why the
 *      lead-ins differ by kind but the count and order never do.
 *   2. **Readability** — the text that actually reaches a reader carries no
 *      token a stranger cannot resolve from the page: no decision id, no
 *      section sign, no forge number, no retired public name, no tranche
 *      slug, no repo-internal path, and no label vocabulary (namespaced or
 *      retired alike — a published page should name neither, and flagging only
 *      the current grammar would leave every retired mention invisible).
 *
 * **What "published" means here is deliberately narrow.** For a role or
 * contract it is the short version, not the file. For `enforcement.md` it is
 * the introduction plus the four columns the page renders — the row's own
 * name, `Summary`, `Category`, `Description`. The enforcing columns (`Gate`,
 * `What must be true…`, `Re-verifies`, `Runs`, `Catches`, `implementation`,
 * `lock`) are never scanned: they never reach a page, and flagging them would
 * demand rewriting the gate registry to suit a website. Columns resolve by
 * HEADER NAME, never by index — the three ring tables have different shapes,
 * and `Summary`/`Category`/`Description` are the ones spelled identically in
 * all three, the same property `registry-parse.ts` relies on for
 * `Description`.
 *
 * **Protocol mechanics are published on purpose.** `.worktrees/task/<tranche>/<n>`
 * and the `task/<tranche>/<n>` branch convention are the method an adopter
 * must learn, not this repo's internals — they are masked out before scanning
 * so a path rule can never eat them, and that exemption is tested rather than
 * incidental.
