/**
 * AEG anchored-region grammar (aeg-governance-hardening task 30, #393). Pure —
 * no `fs`, no `gh`/`git`.
 *
 * One anchor syntax for every gate-read field: an HTML comment pair
 * `<!-- AEG:<FIELD>:START -->` … `<!-- AEG:<FIELD>:END -->` delimiting the
 * field's one canonical home inside a PR/Issue body. HTML comments render
 * invisibly on the forge, survive inside `<details>` blocks, and can never be
 * produced accidentally by freeform prose — which is exactly the failure class
 * this closes (PR #392's pasted reference brief duplicated its own Test Plan
 * inside the PR body; #363/#377 were the same shape as real bugs).
 *
 * Recognition semantics, shared by every consumer
 * (`pr-tier.ts`, `test-plan-section.ts`, `premise-check.ts`,
 * `brief-validation.ts`/`archive-task.ts`'s Project read, and the `Closes #N`
 * reads in `coherence-checks.ts`/`archive-task.ts`):
 *
 *   - **Anchors are additive, never required.** A body with no anchor pair for
 *     a field parses byte-identically to the pre-anchor behavior — every
 *     already-merged PR/Issue keeps reading exactly as today.
 *   - **When a pair is present, it is authoritative.** The consumer reads the
 *     field exclusively from inside the pair and ignores identical-looking
 *     text anywhere else in the body — there is deliberately no fallback to
 *     body-wide search, since falling back would resurrect the decoy problem
 *     the anchor exists to solve.
 *   - **First pair wins** when a field is (incorrectly) anchored twice —
 *     mirroring the first-match-wins philosophy of the existing prose parsers.
 *   - **A `START` with no following `END` is treated as no anchor at all**
 *     (prose fallback) — a malformed half-pair must not be able to hide a
 *     field from the gates.
 *   - **Markers inside fenced code blocks or inline code spans do not count**
 *     — example/quoted anchor syntax in documentation or evidence output is
 *     never mistaken for a real anchor (same code-stripping philosophy as
 *     `archive-task.ts`'s `stripCode`, #311 regression).
 *
 * The field line/block goes on its own line(s) INSIDE the pair — e.g.
 *
 *     <!-- AEG:TIER:START -->
 *     **Tier:** 1
 *     <!-- AEG:TIER:END -->
 *
 * Deliberately minimal: five field names, one shape. This is a delimiting
 * convention, not a metadata DSL; resist adding structure to it.

 *
 * **This is the same code recognition as `stripCode`, and must stay so.** It ran
 * on the naive `` /```[\s\S]*?```/g `` + single-backtick regexes long after
 * `stripCode` was hardened off them, 27 lines below in this same file — so a
 * decoy `AEG:CLOSES` anchor inside a tilde fence, a ≥4-backtick fence, or a
 * double-backtick span was invisible to the mask, won `anchoredRegion`, and
 * `extractClosesReferences`/`extractIssue` then resolved a *wrong* Issue number
 * (PR #617 review). That is worse than the strandings this PR exists to fix: the
 * post-merge Archivist reads `extractIssue` to explicitly close the Issue, so
 * the failure mode is closing an unrelated Issue, not failing to close one. The
 * two functions differ **only** in what they emit for a code line — filler here,
 * nothing in `stripCode` — which is why both delegate to the same scanners
 * rather than each carrying a copy of the grammar. A divergence between them is
 * a bug by construction, not a style difference.
 *
 * Unlike `stripCode`, this one **must not normalise line endings**: doing so
 * would change the body's length and break the 1:1 index mapping that is this
 * function's entire purpose. The fence patterns therefore tolerate a trailing
 * `\r` themselves, and the filler covers it (a masked `\r` becomes a space —
 * same length, and the mask is never read as text, only searched for marker
 * positions).

 * Removes fenced code blocks and inline code spans entirely, so example/quoted

 * ignores `Closes #N` inside code — a gate that strips the same way can never
 * pass a body GitHub then refuses to auto-close (#311 regression, #608/#611
 * strandings). Unlike `maskCode`, indices are NOT preserved: use this when you
 * only test/scan the stripped text, `maskCode` when you must map positions back
 * onto the original body. Shared by `archive-task.ts` (provenance Issue read),
 * `brief-validation.ts` (`checkClosesN`), and `coherence-checks.ts`
 * (`extractClosesReferences`) — one stripper, never a duplicated regex.
 *
 * Inline spans are matched by CommonMark's rule: an opening run of N backticks
 * is closed by the next run of exactly N backticks on the same line. The
 * `(`+)…\1` backreference is what makes a **double**-backtick span
 * (`` ``Closes #5`` ``) strip as one unit — an earlier `` `[^`\n]*` `` form
 * instead peeled the outer backticks as two empty spans and left the inner
 * `Closes #5` surviving as bare text (a false-green: passed the gate, but
 * GitHub, seeing a code span, refused to auto-close — PR #617 review). Fenced
 * blocks are stripped first (see `maskFencedCode`) so a fence line is never
 * mis-read as an inline span; 4-space **indented** code blocks are stripped in
 * between (see `maskIndentedCode`).

/*
 * **Call this on a WHOLE body, never on a slice of one.** Every rule here is
 * block-structural — a fence pairs with its own closer, an indented run counts
 * as code only after a blank line and outside list context — so the same text
 * strips differently depending on what precedes it. Slicing first and stripping
 * second silently changes the answer: an anchor indented inside a list item is
 * list content in the full body (kept; GitHub auto-closes it) and a bare
 * indented code block once sliced (blanked), which reintroduced a stranded
 * Issue through `extractIssue` (PR #617 review MAJOR). Strip, then slice — the
 * `AEG:*` markers are HTML comments and survive the strip, so region selection
 * works on stripped text, and a decoy anchor inside code never survives to be
 * sliced at all.
