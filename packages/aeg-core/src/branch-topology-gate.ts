 * Branch↔topology gate (aeg-governance-hardening task 32, #399). Pure — no
 * `fs`, no shell-outs. The CLI shim (`bin/check-branch-topology.ts`) derives
 * the iteration from the forge (`@atta/aeg-forge-state`, task
 * aeg-forge-state-v1 3a) and passes the result (or `null` when no iteration
 * data could be derived) in here.
 *
 * Closes the D-073 logic fork: `.husky/pre-push` used to answer "does this
 * branch's task-id suffix have a topology row?" with a hand-rolled
 * `grep -qE "^\|[[:space:]]*${id}[[:space:]]*\|"` against the iteration
 * file — a bash reimplementation of the table-parsing that `parseIteration`
 * used to do here, and that forge-derivation now does instead. Row
 * membership is `topology.tasks`, and the refusal messages are byte-identical
 * to the inline ones the hook printed before.
