// touches — and three task Issues in `vinaya-pages-v2` (#621/#622/#626) passed
// it while being wrong in three distinct ways: a `packages/ui` edit declared
// `Project: vinaya` only (blast radius under-declared, so the review fans out
// through one product's lens instead of every consumer's); a `## References`
// block copied brief-time content into the Issue, where it goes stale before
// work starts; and nothing forced the rationale to name the docs/skills it
// touches, because the skill-check hook fires on file edits and a forge write
// edits no file. The checks below are those three failures turned into
// deterministic functions on the surface they happened on.
//
// EVERY ONE OF THEM READS BLOCK-STRIPPED TEXT, via the single exported
// `stripCode` — never a second regex (PR #617's rule). A rationale that quotes
// `## References`, `Premise:`, or a `packages/ui` path inside a **fence** is
// documenting, not leaking, and must not trip anything; GitHub's own parsers
// ignore code the same way.
//
// They differ on **inline spans**, and the split is not cosmetic:
//
//   - B looks for brief-shaped *headings*, which never live in a span, so it
//     takes the full default strip.
//   - A/C/D look for *paths*, and prose writes paths in backticks by
//     convention — #621 declares its own surface as "edits `packages/ui`". Run
//     span-blind, A matches nothing on the very Issues it was built from and
//     ships as a gate that always passes, which is worse than no gate. So they
//     read `PATH_TEXT`: fences and indented blocks gone, spans intact.
//
// Accepted cost: brief content that leaks *entirely inside* a fence is
// invisible to B. Same trade every code-aware gate here makes; the alternative
// is the fence-blind false-positive machine #617 removed.
