/**
 * Reader-resolvable prose — classes 1 and 2 of the three-class analysis in
 * Issue #694: the two mechanizable classes of "words a reader cannot
 * resolve." Class 3 (register/slop — padding adjectives, first person,
 * narrating the work episode) is NOT here; it stays with the review role,
 * per the measurement below.
 *
 * **The measurement that disqualifies a phrase blacklist.** A phrase
 * blacklist tested against the real corpus (all of `aeg-root` plus 1,157
 * TypeScript files) scored 14 hits, 14 false positives, 0 true positives —
 * "a review was *requested*"; "could *this change* leak a secret"; "*I have*
 * X, Y, Z" inside a quoted example. The fix is not tuning the word list; it
 * is asking a different question:
 *
 *   - Class 1 (references): not "does this phrase appear" but "does this
 *     doctrine cite a forge number or tranche slug the reader has no forge to
 *     resolve." Reuses the same two pattern shapes proven in
 *     `retired-vocabulary.test.ts` (`FORGE_NUMBER_PATTERN`,
 *     `TRANCHE_SLUG_VN_PATTERN`, and the legacy-slug list derived — not
 *     guessed — from `aeg-root/tranches/completed/*.md` filenames), scoped to
 *     the reader-facing surfaces instead of banned repo-wide (the same digit
 *     shape is this product's own live `Closes #N`/PR-number grammar
 *     elsewhere, so a repo-wide ban would flag the mechanism, not the
 *     citation habit).
 *   - Class 2 (vocabulary): not "is this word forbidden" but "does this
 *     reader-facing file use a coined term while neither defining it inline
 *     nor linking a definition." The term list is derived from
 *     `aeg-root/glossary.md`'s own entry headings — never hard-coded — so it
 *     cannot drift the first time an entry is added.
 *
 * Zero I/O: every input (file paths + contents, the glossary's term list, the
 * legacy-slug list) is read by the adapter and passed in. POSIX-ERE-safe
 * patterns only — no `\d`/`\w`/`\s`/lookaheads, and no `\b` relied on after a
 * non-word character (the exact regression class `retired-vocabulary.test.ts`
 * already paid for) — even though these patterns run through native
 * `RegExp`, not `grep -E`, keeping them portable to either.
