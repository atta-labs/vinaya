/**
 * New-on-disk-state guard (#512 Part D). Pure — no `fs`, no `git`/`gh` I/O.
 * Flags a diff-touched path as a disk-state offender given its change
 * status (`added` — the path didn't exist on the base ref — or `modified`
 * — it already did):
 *
 * (a) A live iteration topology file directly under `aeg-root/iterations/`
 *     (not a subdirectory), other than `README.md` — the residue class
 *     this task's own Part B proved unnecessary (forge derivation already
 *     covers it, see `aeg-drift-prevention-v1.md`'s deletion). Fails on
 *     `added` OR `modified`: this file class shouldn't exist at all
 *     post-cutover, whether newly created or resurrected via an edit.
 *
 * (b) Any `.md` file anywhere under `aeg-root/iterations/` (any depth,
 *     including `completed/**`), other than `README.md` — but ONLY when
 *     `added`. `completed/**`'s existing files are legacy archive
 *     (D-117 explicitly excludes them, per `iterations/README.md` §4/§11 —
 *     they're never deleted or migrated, and editing one to fix a typo
 *     must stay legal); this rule instead closes the gap a path-shape-only
 *     exemption would leave open — a BRAND NEW file smuggled directly into
 *     `completed/` (or any other subdirectory) to dodge rule (a)'s
 *     top-level check. Deliberately status-based, not a hardcoded filename
 *     allowlist: the legacy set only grows via the (currently-dormant,
 *     forge-native-cutover-pending) Archivist move-to-completed flow, never
 *     via this gate's own exemption logic.
 *
 * (c) Any `*.tokens.md` file, anywhere in the repo — the pre-D-071 ledger
 *     shape `Tokens-in-PR-body` superseded — but ONLY when `added` (an
 *     edit to one of the 4 existing legacy `completed/*.tokens.md` files
 *     must stay legal, same reasoning as (b)).
