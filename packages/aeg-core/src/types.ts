 * `dropped` and `incoherent` are the two **honest terminal** statuses (D-069).
 * A closed Issue with no merged PR must never resolve to `todo` (which implies
 * not-started). `dropped` = closed `NOT_PLANNED` (legitimately abandoned);
 * `incoherent` = closed `COMPLETED` but with no merged-PR link (genuinely done
 * yet unprovable, or a broken close). Both are surfaced, never hidden.
