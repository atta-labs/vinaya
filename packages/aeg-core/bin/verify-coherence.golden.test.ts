/**
 * Golden comparison (aeg-forge-state-v1 3b, #437, Part 3): proves the
 * forge-derived `id`/`issue` `loadIterationFiles` now uses for every
 * non-touched iteration matches the pre-3b file-parsed topology table, for
 * every currently active iteration — not a fixture, the live repo.
 *
 * Scoped to `id`/`issue` only (NOT `dependsOn`/`conflictsWith`) — a
 * deliberate narrowing per the Planner's triage on Issue #437. The original,
 * unscoped version of this test (comparing `dependsOn` too) found real
 * divergence across all 5 active iterations: legacy Issues predating the
 * "Dependency rationale" grammar carry no forge-parseable dependency
 * data, stale Issue bodies drift from topology-table edits, and
 * `parse-rationale-deps.ts` has its own cross-iteration-qualified-ref gaps.
 * `loadIterationFiles` (`verify-coherence.ts`) responded by keeping
 * `dependsOn`/`conflictsWith` sourced from the topology table itself,
 * merged onto the forge-derived task list — this test's job is to prove the
 * two fields that DID get cut over (`id`, `issue`) are safe to, not to
 * re-litigate the fields that didn't.
 *
 * Comparing the full `Iteration`/`Task` object beyond that would be both
 * unnecessary and actively wrong: a forge-derived `Task.rationaleMarkdown` is
 * the Issue's full body, while the file-parsed version is only the topology
 * file's own `### Task <id> — …` block — different by design (see
 * `derive-from-forge.ts`'s own docstring), and neither field is read by any
 * coherence check (confirmed by inspection of `coherence-checks.ts`).
 *
 * Lives here in aeg-core, not in aeg-forge-state, per this task's own
 * constraint (a prior cross-package version of this test was deleted in
 * task 3a — see that task's PR #440 — specifically because it belonged with
 * the consumer, not the standalone adapter).
 *
 * Requires live `gh`/forge access (a real `resolveRepo()` + working `gh`
 * auth) to be a meaningful proof — skips (not fails) when neither is
 * available, since that means every derivation call falls back to the file
 * read anyway and the comparison degrades to file-vs-file (vacuously true,
 * not informative). CI (`ci.yml`'s `typecheck-and-tests` job) now carries
 * `GH_TOKEN` specifically so this runs as a real proof there, not a skip.
