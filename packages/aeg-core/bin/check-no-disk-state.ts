/**
 * check-no-disk-state — CI gate (#512) blocking new on-disk state-file
 * creation: a live `aeg-root/iterations/*.md` topology file (other than
 * `README.md`, at any depth including `completed/**` when newly added) —
 * the residue class this task's Part B proved unnecessary
 * (`aeg-drift-prevention-v1.md` deleted, forge derivation covers it) — or
 * any newly-added `*.tokens.md` file, anywhere in the repo (tokens
 * live in the PR body, not a committed ledger). Pure predicate lives in
 * `isNewDiskStateFile` (`@atta/aeg-core`) — this is a thin CLI/I/O shim.
 *
 * Status-aware (`git diff --name-status`), not path-shape-only: editing an
 * EXISTING file under `aeg-root/iterations/completed/**` (the 15 legacy
 * archive files) stays legal — only genuinely NEW files there are
 * refused, closing the gap a path-shape-only exemption would leave open (a
 * brand-new file smuggled into `completed/` to dodge the top-level check).
 * A top-level active topology file (directly under `aeg-root/iterations/`,
 * not a subdirectory) fails on add OR edit — that class shouldn't exist at
 * all post-cutover. Deleted files are never checked (this task's own
 * removal of `aeg-drift-prevention-v1.md` must not trip it).
 *
 * Usage (CI): bun packages/aeg-core/bin/check-no-disk-state.ts
 * Exit code: 0 (pass / no matching file in the diff) or 1 (a new/edited
 * state file found — named in the message).
