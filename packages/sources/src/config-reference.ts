 * The `vinaya.config.json` reference — an AUTHORED registry, not a Zod
 * introspection. `apps/vinaya/cli/src/lib/config.ts`'s `VinayaConfigSchema`
 * validates SHAPE only (zero `.describe()` calls); this module is the one
 * place semantics are written down in adopter-facing prose. Content is
 * reconciled from two sources of truth — `config.ts`'s own comments and
 * `specs/vinaya-spec.md`'s Configuration architecture chapter — never
 * invented.
 *
 * `apps/vinaya/cli/tests/checks/config-reference-coverage.test.ts` proves
 * every `VinayaConfigSchema` top-level key and every `CheckEntrySchema` key
 * has a row here, by key-presence only (it does not check prose accuracy —
 * that is a review concern, not a mechanizable one).
 *
 * `web` renders this registry (`apps/vinaya/web/src/app/(site)/config`);
 * `web` must never import `cli` internals, so this lives sources-side,
 * exactly like `commands.ts`'s `COMMANDS`.
