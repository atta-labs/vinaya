 * Golden comparison (brief §1 Context point 3, §9 Part C1): proves the
 * forge-backed and file-backed StateSource designs produce equivalent
 * `Iteration` shapes for the same real iteration, `aeg-forge-state-v1`.
 *
 * `aeg-root/iterations/completed/aeg-forge-state-v1.md` was deleted today by
 * PR #521 (part of the archived-iteration-reads-migrate-to-forge work) — the
 * live working-tree path has nothing to parse. The file's last content
 * before deletion is recoverable from git history and is still a genuine
 * real-data comparison: deleting the `.md` file didn't touch the Milestone
 * or Issues it was derived from, which still exist on GitHub.
