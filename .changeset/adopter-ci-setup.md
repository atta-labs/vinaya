Adopter-declared CI setup: a new optional `ci.setup` key in `vinaya.config.json`, emitted verbatim as an "Adopter CI setup" step in the generated workflows that execute `vinaya check` (checks, review, review-verdict — never the archivist, whose jobs spawn no adopter code).

The generated jobs previously installed node and nothing else — correct for vinaya's own checks, which arrive whole via `npx`, and fatal for an adopter's custom checks, which are scripts in the adopter's own repository that may import the adopter's own code. Measured on the first non-greenfield adopter: both of its custom checks failed as `error (2ms)` spawn failures on every CI run while passing in the local hooks, turning a required check permanently red.

The command is declared in the committed config, never inferred — vinaya cannot know an adopter's package manager or runtime. When the key is absent, the generated workflows are byte-identical to before it existed, so existing installs see no churn. Note for repos that do declare it: the generated workflows are managed artifacts, so the next `vinaya upgrade` after declaring the key rewrites their bytes — that is the intended delivery path, not drift.

`@atta/vinaya-sources` gains the matching `ci` / `ci.setup` rows in the adopter-facing config reference.
