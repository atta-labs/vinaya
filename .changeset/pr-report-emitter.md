New `vinaya pr report --write <body-file>` emits the `AEG:EVIDENCE` block — a PR body's head sha, a width-invariant `git diff --numstat`, and the result of `vinaya check --all --diff-only` — from commands, never typed by hand. The new `evidence-fresh` core check refuses a PR body whose block doesn't match the head it's attached to: it recomputes and exact-compares the diff stat (closing fabrication for that fact) and checks the attested gate run for staleness only, against the PR's real head resolved via `gh` (never `HEAD`, which is the merge commit in CI). `ANCHOR_FIELDS` gains `EVIDENCE`; `aeg-root/templates/pr-report-template.md` and `aeg-root/roles/developer.md` both route their PR-body "evidence" section through the new anchor instead of free text.
