`vinaya issue create` now auto-attaches a new task Issue to its tranche's open Milestone — a `resolveMilestoneAttachTarget` resolver (`@attalabs/aeg-forge-state`) matches the legacy exact-slug-titled Milestone or, new, an intent-declared one (`### Tranche intents`), and always hands `gh` the Milestone's own TITLE rather than the slug. Explicit `--milestone` on argv still wins; no matching open Milestone silently skips attach rather than failing the create. Fixes the gap where the only documented path (`milestone create` then `issue create` per task) left every task Issue labeled but never attached, and fixes the pre-existing `open-issue.ts` auto-attach, which crashed intent-declared-tranche creates by handing `gh` a slug no Milestone was titled.
