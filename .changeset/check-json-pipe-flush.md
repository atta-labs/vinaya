`vinaya check --json` previously truncated its payload at the reading pipe's buffer, because the process exited on top of a pending asynchronous stdout write — a file redirect never exposed it, since a file's stdout write is synchronous. Any consumer piping the output, `vinaya pr report` among them, received unparseable JSON above that buffer. The payload now drains before the process exits, with exit codes unchanged.
