Fix the `doc-coverage` check so an applied `vinaya/waiver:docs` label actually takes effect. It previously read `PR_LABELS`/`WAIVER_LABEL_ACTOR` from the environment, expecting the CI workflow to inject them — but no generated `vinaya-checks.yml`, old or current, ever set either var, so the waiver path was silently unreachable in every adopter's CI (caught live on atta-labs/attalabs#948). The check now resolves the label and its labeling actor live via `gh`, from `PR_NUMBER`, the same way `review-gate` already does — no workflow template change needed, and every already-generated `vinaya-checks.yml` is fixed in place.
