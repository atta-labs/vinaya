`vinaya studio` now launches for real in a published install. `bundle-studio.ts` fetches attalabs' CI-built standalone Studio bundle from its public release artifact (`atta-labs/attalabs`'s `vinaya-studio-artifact.yml` workflow, no token required) and assembles it into `studio-standalone/` at `prepack` time, instead of requiring a Studio source tree this repository never had. The default ports move from `3006`/`3106` (the retired `apps/vinaya/web`'s ports) to `3008`/`3108` (matching `apps/vinaya-studio/web`'s own docs). `packages/sources/src/commands.ts`'s `studio` row and `verify-published-lifecycle.ts`'s `studio` exercise both now describe and assert a real launch instead of the prior honest refusal.
