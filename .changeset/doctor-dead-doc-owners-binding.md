`vinaya doctor` now flags `.vinaya/doc-owners` bindings whose code glob matches no tracked file in the repo, or whose doc pointer doesn't exist on disk — both silent gaps the diff-scoped C5 gate structurally cannot see on its own, since a glob matching nothing trivially satisfies "did the docs change" for every diff. Report-only, like every other `doctor` diagnostic — it never mutates `.vinaya/doc-owners` and is not a `vinaya check` gate.
