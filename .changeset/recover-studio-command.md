Recover the `vinaya studio` command the extraction dropped.

Four files (`commands/studio.ts`, `lib/studio-bundle.ts`, `scripts/bundle-studio.ts`, `tests/studio.test.ts`) lived at `apps/vinaya/cli/**` in the attalabs monorepo. The extraction moved the CLI to this repository without them, and attalabs then deleted the directory they were in — the command survived only in that repo's history, absent from both repos, the router, and the published tarball, with no gate noticing.

They are recovered here against the two-repo reality: Studio's source (`apps/vinaya/web`) stayed in attalabs, so the workspace branch of `resolveStudioTarget` serves only checkouts that carry that tree, and no published build bundles the standalone Studio app. Rather than fixing import paths and shipping a command that resolves nothing, the recovered command refuses explicitly (exit 1, message naming the package) in every shape it cannot yet serve. `bundle-studio.ts` is recovered as pack-shape knowledge but deliberately not wired into `prepack` or the `files` allowlist — producing and shipping the bundle is the separate Studio-packaging task, so the published artifact's contents are unchanged.

`@atta/vinaya-sources` gains the matching `studio` row in the `COMMANDS` registry, with an honest description of what the command does and does not yet do; `verify-published-lifecycle.ts` exercises the refusal for real against the packed artifact.
