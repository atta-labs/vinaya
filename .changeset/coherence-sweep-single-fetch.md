The repo-wide coherence sweep stops re-fetching forge data it already holds. `verify-coherence.ts`'s `loadTrancheFiles` derived each tranche independently, so a repo with N Milestones paid N re-pulls of the entire Milestone list plus N serial `gh issue list` calls, and L4/L5 then re-issued those same N Issue queries a second time for the `milestone` field a `Tranche` drops. The sweep now enumerates every tranche first, indexes Milestones once (`indexTrancheMilestonesAsync`), fetches each tranche's labeled Issues exactly once at a bounded concurrency of 4, and derives both the task list and L4's Milestone-attachment facts from that single response. Measured against `atta-labs/vinaya` (6 Milestones): 21 `gh` calls and 26.4 s become 7 and 9.5 s, with byte-identical report JSON — the derivation, the checks, and the verdict are unchanged, only the round trips are gone. New `@attalabs/aeg-forge-state` exports for callers that hold forge data already: `indexTrancheMilestonesAsync`, `fetchTrancheIssuesAsync`, `trancheFromIssues`, `tasksFromIssues`, `issueMilestonesFromIssues`, and the `TrancheMilestoneIndex`/`GhIssue` types. Every existing export keeps its signature and behaviour.
