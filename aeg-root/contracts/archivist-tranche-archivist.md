# Contract: per-task Archivist → Tranche Archivist

## The short version

This seam sits between closing out one task and closing out the tranche that contained it. It exists because a tranche's history is only honest if each task's history was completed first.

**What crosses** — the set of merged pull requests, each carrying its own provenance record. That record is what proves a task was genuinely closed out rather than merely merged. Alongside it: a note on the standing lessons thread for any serious finding that was raised in review and merged anyway, so a consciously accepted deviation is available as a pattern later; and a follow-up issue for every finding that the product's specification has gone stale, so the gap outlives the task that found it.

**The hand-off is malformed when** — a merged pull request carries no provenance record. That means the task's close-out never ran, and the tranche's retrospective would then be assembled from a gap rather than a fact. It is malformed in the same way when an accepted deviation left no note, or when a stale-specification finding left no follow-up: in each case something real happened and nothing durable records it.

**What it does not carry** — permission to proceed on partial evidence. A partial close-out is worse than none, because it produces a record that looks complete and is not. It also carries no new judgement: nothing here re-opens, re-reviews or re-decides a merged task; both roles assemble from facts, and neither authors one.

**How it physically runs** — the carrier is the merged pull requests themselves, each with its provenance comment, plus the standing lessons thread and any follow-up issues. Tranche close-out reads them and stops if one is missing, flagging exactly which task's record is incomplete rather than working around it. The retrospective it then writes is a structured projection of those facts — assembled from merged work, recorded lessons and the decisions of the period, never generated from memory.

## Reference

**Status:** active
**Seam:** the hand-off from the per-task Archivist (producer) to the Tranche Archivist (consumer).
**Single source of truth for this seam.** The two role docs do **not** redefine what crosses this boundary — they point here. `aeg-root/roles/archivist.md` (producer side) and `aeg-root/roles/tranche-archivist.md` (consumer side) each reference this file; this file is where the field-by-field hand-off lives, once.

---

## Why this file exists

The per-task Archivist closes out individual tasks; the Tranche Archivist closes out the whole tranche. The Tranche Archivist's close-out is only honest if every per-task Archivist ran correctly — a missing provenance block means a task's history is incomplete, and an incomplete history means the retrospective is assembled from gaps rather than facts. This contract specifies exactly what the per-task Archivist must produce before the Tranche Archivist is authorized to begin, and exactly what the Tranche Archivist reads from those outputs.

The failure mode this prevents: a Tranche Archivist who begins close-out before verifying that every task's per-task Archivist ran, and then assembles a retrospective and tranche provenance block that silently omits a task's history or fabricates fields whose source facts were never produced.

---

## The hand-off carrier

The **set of merged PRs**, each bearing a per-task provenance block comment, plus the **tranche file** at `aeg-root/tranches/<name>.md` which provides the task topology the Tranche Archivist checks against. Every task in the topology must have a merged PR with a provenance block; the absence of either is a gap the Tranche Archivist must flag before proceeding.

---

## The contract — field-by-field mapping

Every output the per-task Archivist produces (left) has exactly one obligation for the Tranche Archivist (right). A task missing any left-column output is a close-out gap — the Tranche Archivist does not proceed with partial evidence.

| per-task Archivist produces (per task) | Tranche Archivist consumes at | What the consumption means |
|---|---|---|
| **Provenance block comment** on each merged PR | Entry gate verification | The Tranche Archivist verifies every task PR has a provenance block comment before starting close-out. A missing provenance block means that task's per-task Archivist close-out was incomplete — stop and flag: *"Task N's PR has no provenance block — per-task Archivist did not run for this task. Flag for Principal before proceeding."* |
| **Lessons Issue comments** for any `BLOCKER`/`MAJOR` findings that merged | Retrospective assembly | The Tranche Archivist reads the pinned lessons Issue's comments since the tranche started and includes the patterns they identify in the retrospective's "What stalled or caused rework" and "Carry-forward lessons" sections. |
| **Follow-up Issues** opened for `STALE-SPEC` findings | State doc update | The Tranche Archivist notes open follow-up Issues in the relevant pinned state Issue under "Pending manual operations" (or in the output report as DANGLING items). A `STALE-SPEC` finding with no follow-up Issue is a DANGLING item — flag it for the Principal. (`now.md` is retired.) |

**Reading the table:** left is the producer obligation (per-task Archivist role doc and this contract enforce it), right is the consumer obligation (Tranche Archivist role doc and this contract enforce it). The two role docs must not contradict this table.

## Producer obligations (the per-task Archivist)

- Post a provenance block comment on every merged task PR — no exceptions. This is the single most critical output: without it, the Tranche Archivist's entry gate fails and close-out cannot proceed.
- Post a new comment on the pinned lessons Issue for every `BLOCKER` or `MAJOR` finding that was present in the Reviewer's verdict and merged anyway (a deviation). A deviation without a lessons entry is a missed learning.
- Open a follow-up Issue for every `STALE-SPEC` finding identified by the Reviewer. If the Developer already opened one, confirm it exists; do not open a duplicate.
- Append one row to the tranche's token ledger at close-out.

## Consumer obligations (the Tranche Archivist)

- Verify every task PR has a provenance block comment before starting. If any is missing, stop and flag — do not proceed with partial close-out. Partial close-out is worse than no close-out: it creates a plausible-looking but incomplete record.
- Read the pinned lessons Issue's comments since the tranche start date before assembling the retrospective. Carry-forward lessons that appear there but are not reflected in the retrospective are a gap.
- Note open follow-up Issues in the relevant pinned state Issue (under "Pending manual operations") or in the close-out report as DANGLING items. If a `STALE-SPEC` finding has no follow-up Issue (the per-task Archivist missed it), flag it as DANGLING and open the Issue on behalf of the Principal. (`now.md` is retired.)
- Do not assemble the tranche retrospective from memory or inference — assemble it from merged PR summaries, the pinned lessons Issue's comments, and the tranche topology file. The retrospective is a structured projection of facts.

## Changing this contract

A contract changes **as a unit**. You may not change what the per-task Archivist produces without, in the same change, updating what the Tranche Archivist consumes — because the property that makes the seam sound is that the producer's output side is *identical* to the consumer's input side. Concretely:

- A change to this file is a **Tier 3** change: it alters a cross-role contract, so the reasoning belongs in the pull request that makes it, where the reviewer and the close-out both read it.
- The same PR that edits this contract must verify both `aeg-root/roles/archivist.md` and `aeg-root/roles/tranche-archivist.md` still point here and still match the table.
- Never edit one side's role doc to add/drop a hand-off field directly. Add/drop it **here**; the role docs inherit it by reference.

*This contract is the seam. The per-task Archivist fills the left column; the Tranche Archivist drains the right. One source of truth, changed as a unit.*
