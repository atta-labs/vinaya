# Contract: Planner → Brief Author

## The short version

This seam sits between planning a tranche and writing one task's brief. It exists because a role boundary is where work is lost: the planner does a deep technical pass, and without a contract its conclusions quietly fail to arrive.

**What crosses** — the planner's rationale for one task, written into that task's issue: what the task is and deliberately is not; why it is one task rather than three; every project and shared-package consumer in its blast radius; why each dependency and conflict edge exists; the traps the dig already found; the class of agent the work needs; when the executing agent must stop rather than improvise; and the documents this work will make incoherent. Each has exactly one named home in the brief that consumes it, so a conclusion cannot arrive without a place to land.

**The hand-off is malformed when** — a rationale is missing any of those parts, in which case the planner does not emit it; or when a brief drops one on the floor, in which case the brief is wrong rather than merely thin. It is malformed too when the rationale carries detail that cannot survive the wait — exact signatures, precise file lists — which goes stale between planning and dispatch; re-deriving that fresh is the brief author's half. And when the brief author's own dig contradicts the rationale, that is escalated back, never silently overridden.

**What it does not carry** — the brief itself, which is written later and lives elsewhere; any statement of status, which is derived from the forge and never written down; scheduling or estimates, which belong to whatever tool plans the roadmap; and the freshly pinned facts a brief asserts about current code, which belong entirely to the next seam.

**How it physically runs** — the carrier is the task's issue body. The planner writes the rationale there in a fixed grammar, readable by a person and checkable by a machine alike; an issue whose body does not carry every part is refused at creation, and the same check re-runs against issues already open. The brief author reads it there and writes the brief, which lands in the pull-request body at dispatch. The issue holds the reasoning; the pull request holds the instruction.

## Reference

**Status:** active
**Seam:** the hand-off from the Planner (producer) to the Brief Author (consumer).
**Single source of truth for this seam.** The two role docs do **not** redefine what crosses this boundary — they point here. `aeg-root/roles/planner.md` (producer side) and `aeg-root/skills/brief-authoring/SKILL.md` (consumer side) each reference this file; this file is where the field-by-field hand-off lives, once.

---

## Why this file exists

A role boundary is where work is lost. The Planner does a deep technical pass and produces durable conclusions; the Brief Author must consume *every one* of them or the conclusion is dropped and the executing agent walks into a trap the planner already saw. When the hand-off is described separately in each role doc, the two descriptions drift (they already did once — the brief side was missing "Sizing" and "Dependency rationale" that the planner side required). A **contract** removes the drift structurally: there is exactly one description of the seam, and both roles are bound to it.

This is the first of AEG's role-seam contracts. Others (`brief-developer`, `developer-reviewer`, …) follow the same shape as each seam is modeled. A contract is a Class 1 artifact and changes **as a unit** — see "Changing this contract" below.

---

## The hand-off carrier

The Planner's output unit is the **task**, which exists as a forge Issue (identity + metadata + Planner's rationale) and a row in the tranche topology file (Issue link + edges only). The thing that crosses this seam is the **Planner's rationale** block, which the Planner writes into the **Issue body**. The Brief Author reads the rationale from the Issue — the forge artifact — and turns it into the executable brief that lands in the PR body. The tranche file row is a topology pointer (the Issue number); the Issue is the definition.

The Planner persists **durable conclusions** (which do not decay). The Brief Author adds **perishable detail** (current signatures, exact files, final model pick) at dispatch. Neither re-does the other's half; the rationale is the carrier between them, and the Issue is its home.

---

## The contract — field-by-field mapping

Every field the Planner emits in the rationale (left) has exactly one named home in the brief (right). The Planner MUST emit every left-column field; the Brief Author MUST consume every one into the named brief section. A rationale missing a field is malformed (Planner refuses). A brief that drops a field on the floor is malformed (Brief Author error).

| Planner emits (rationale field) | Brief Author consumes it in (brief section) | What the consumption means |
|---|---|---|
| **Boundary** (what this task is / is not) | Context + Technical Surface Map | The brief's scope and out-of-surface set are the planner's boundary made concrete against current code. |
| **Sizing** (passed the four "too big?" tests) | Re-confirmation only | The brief assumes the task is one PR. If the Brief Author's own dig finds it no longer fits (code moved), that is **stop-and-escalate**, not a silent re-split. |
| **Project(s) + blast radius** (every project/consumer touched) | `Project:` field + blast-radius re-verification in the Done checklist | The brief carries the identical `Project(s)`; the Done checklist re-verifies every blast-radius consumer the planner named. |
| **Dependency rationale** (why each depends-on / conflicts-with edge) | Technical Dependencies | The brief turns the *why* of each edge into the concrete "what must already exist" preconditions (exports, migrations, capabilities, merged dependencies). |
| **Traps to avoid** (concrete pitfalls the dig surfaced) | Context + Constraints | The trap becomes an explicit "do NOT do X; do Y instead" the executing agent cannot miss. Highest-value field — never drop it. |
| **Suggested agent-class** (high/mid/fast + one-line reason) | `For:` + `Reason:` header | The Brief Author confirms or deviates (with stated reason) and makes the **final** model pick. Class is the planner's; pick is the brief's. |
| **Stop-and-escalate** (when the agent must stop, not improvise) | Stop conditions | The planner's stop conditions are copied into the brief's stop-condition list verbatim in substance. |
| **Docs to keep coherent** (which specs/skills/docs this task will make incoherent) | the documentation-update list | The Brief Author turns the Planner's named list into the explicit doc-update items. Conditional: if the Planner stated "No docs touched," the list is "No doc updates required (Tier 0)." If the Planner named docs, they are all in the list. Presence-**and-correctness** of the list is the Planner's mechanical obligation, not naming docs from memory: the Planner names intended surfaces and the Brief Author derives the floor at brief-authoring time by matching those surfaces against `.vinaya/doc-owners` (`deriveSection7`), then supplements from the read obligation. Any override of the derived floor (added doc, or a derived pointer marked out of scope) must carry a one-line reason in the brief — silent overrides are a regression. |

**Reading the table:** left is the producer obligation (Planner role doc enforces it), right is the consumer obligation (brief-authoring skill enforces it). The two role docs must not contradict this table; if either needs to change what it emits or consumes, it changes *here*, and both sides update together.

**Premise pinning is deliberately NOT a field in this table.** `verify-dispatch`/`verify-task`'s `Premise:` block is file-content-level, perishable detail — current signatures, current constants — squarely inside the Brief Author's half of the division of labor this contract already describes, not a durable conclusion the Planner should seed as a rationale field. It is governed entirely by the Brief Author → Developer seam (`contracts/brief-developer.md`), not this one.

## Rationale grammar

The eight left-column fields above are the rationale's **content**; this section defines its **format** — how a field must be written in the Issue body for it to be machine-detectable. Before this grammar existed the rationale was prose with no defined format; a check cannot parse what has no format.

Two serializations are accepted, case-insensitive, matched by field name (or an established synonym — e.g. `Depends-on` for **Dependency rationale**):

- **Bold-inline:** `**<Field>** — <content>` (e.g. `**Boundary** — …`)
- **Heading:** `### <Field>` followed by the content on subsequent lines (e.g. `### Traps to avoid`)

A ready-to-fill skeleton of the full eight-field rationale lives at `aeg-root/templates/issue-rationale-template.md` — copy it rather than reconstructing the shape from this section's prose; this section remains the grammar's definition.

**`Dependency rationale` carries one exception to the two-serialization tolerance above: it must be written `**Dependency rationale** — <content>` exactly** — bold-inline only, with the closing `**` immediately after the label, no colon inside the bold (`**Dependency rationale:**` is rejected) and no heading form. This field alone has a downstream consumer beyond the creation gate: `amendRationaleDeps` (`packages/aeg-forge-state/src/amend-rationale-deps.ts`), the only sanctioned way to edit `Depends-on`/`Conflicts-with` after creation, locates the section by the exact anchor `SECTION_HEADER` (`packages/aeg-forge-state/src/parse-rationale-deps.ts`) and refuses any other form. `checkIssueRationale` imports that same constant rather than a second regex, so a body it accepts is always rewritable by `amend-deps` — the two consumers share one grammar for this field. Found live 2026-08-05 on a real task Issue that used the colon form for all eight fields: it passed creation but could not be amended.

A task Issue's body must carry all eight fields in one of these two forms. **Canonical implementation:** `packages/aeg-core/src/issue-validation.ts` (`checkIssueRationale`, `isTaskIssueLabelSet`) — the single grammar/parser, consumed at two enforcement points per `aeg-root/enforcement.md`'s ring model:

- **Ring 0 (creation gate):** `packages/aeg-core/bin/open-issue.ts` refuses to create or edit a task Issue (any Issue labeled `vinaya/tranche:<slug>`) whose body fails `checkIssueRationale`. **It also refuses on three content checks, which grade what the fields *say* rather than that they exist:**
  - `checkBlastRadiusScope` — if **Boundary** or **Project(s) + blast radius** names a path under a collision domain in `.aeg/packages` that none of the declared projects owns (ownership resolves against `.vinaya/projects.md`), the Issue must declare a second **registered** project or carry a `blast-radius-ack: <why one lens is enough>` line. `Project(s)` drives the review fan-out, so an under-declared blast radius under-governs the change. **Registered is the operative word:** a name with no row in `.vinaya/projects.md` buys no review lens, so it cannot buy the bypass either — the check filters declared names against the registry before counting them. Dormant when `.aeg/packages` is absent.
  - `checkNoBriefContent` — the body must carry no `## References`, `Technical surface map`, `Premise`, `Step 0`, or `Test Plan` section. Those are Brief-Author artifacts; an Issue is not a brief's home (it would go stale before work starts).
  - `checkRationaleNamesDocs` — **Docs to keep coherent** and/or **Traps to avoid** must name at least one concrete doc path (`aeg-root/…`, `.claude/skills/…`, `.claude/rules/…`, `apps/<x>/CLAUDE.md`, `apps/<x>/specs/…`, a repo-level `*.md`). A genuinely doc-less surface uses the explicit `no-doc-surface` sentinel — the same shape as `Test Plan: unit-tests-only`. This is the only read-obligation signal a forge write leaves: the skill-check hook fires on file edits, and cutting an Issue edits no file.

  A fourth check, `checkConflictCompleteness`, **warns and never blocks**: two open task Issues naming the same collision domain with no mutual `Conflicts-with` edge. Non-blocking because an Issue declares no precise file surface, so the overlap is a hint, not a fact.
- **Ring 1/2 (continuous oracle):** `verify-coherence`'s **R1** check re-runs the same function against the live stock of open task Issues, catching bodies edited by ungated writers or predating the gate. Pre-grammar Issues are grandfathered by explicit Issue number (`R1_GRANDFATHERED_ISSUES` in `packages/aeg-core/src/coherence-checks.ts`) — visible as `info`, never blocking.

R1 checks **presence/structure only**; whether the content is correct (sizing actually right, traps actually real) stays the Reviewer's judgment, never CI's.

## Producer obligations (the Planner)

- **Cut a real forge Issue for every task before dispatch.** Before the Brief Author can author a brief, the Planner must have replaced any `#TBD` in the topology table's Issue column with a real GitHub Issue number. A `#TBD` entry means the task has no forge Issue — it is neither briefable nor executable regardless of its derived status. The Brief Author hard-STOPs on `#TBD` during Dig; the Developer hard-STOPs at entry gate item 3. Cutting the Issue makes the task forge-addressable and dispatchable; it is a Planner-only act.
- Emit a rationale block per task containing **all eight left-column fields**. (Enforced in `planner.md` — a task missing its rationale is refused.) The eighth field, **Docs to keep coherent**, must name every spec/skill/doc this task will make incoherent, or state "No docs touched" explicitly. Omitting it forces the Brief Author to populate the documentation-update list from memory — the exact failure the read obligation exists to close.
- The rationale holds durable conclusions only — no perishable line-level detail (that's the Brief Author's half).
- `Project(s)` must include every shared-package consumer in the blast radius (the blast-radius rule in `planner.md`).
- **Read relevant docs before emitting the "Docs to keep coherent" field.** The read obligation requires the Planner to have identified and read the relevant specs/skills/docs before planning. The "Docs to keep coherent" field is only trustworthy if it was derived from reading, not from memory.

## Consumer obligations (the Brief Author)

- Read the rationale first; **start from it, never from a blank page**. (Enforced in `brief-authoring`.)
- Consume **every** right-column mapping — no field dropped.
- Add the perishable detail the planner deliberately left out (current signatures, exact file list, final model pick).
- **Read obligation:** During the Dig, identify and read any specs/skills/docs relevant to this task's code surface. Then (a) surface in Context what the Developer must know from those docs, and (b) populate the documentation-update list from this reading — the Planner's "Docs to keep coherent" field is the starting point, but the Brief Author's own reading may surface additional docs the Planner missed.
- If the Brief Author's own dig **contradicts** the rationale (the boundary moved, sizing no longer holds), that is a `severity:strategy` escalation back toward the Planner — not a silent override.

## Changing this contract

A contract changes **as a unit**. You may not change what the Planner emits without, in the same change, updating what the Brief Author consumes — because the property that makes the seam sound is that the producer's output side is *identical* to the consumer's input side. Concretely:

- A change to this file is a **Tier 3** change: it alters a cross-role contract, so the reasoning belongs in the pull request that makes it, where the reviewer and the close-out both read it.
- The same PR that edits this contract must verify both `planner.md` and `brief-authoring/SKILL.md` still point here and still match the table (they should need no field-level edits, since the fields live here — but their references must stay valid).
- Never edit one side's role doc to add/drop a hand-off field directly. Add/drop it **here**; the role docs inherit it by reference.

*This contract is the seam. The Planner fills the left column; the Brief Author drains the right. One source of truth, changed as a unit.*
