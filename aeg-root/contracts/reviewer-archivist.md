# Contract: Reviewer → per-task Archivist

## The short version

This seam sits between a review and the permanent record of the work it reviewed. It exists because close-out can only be honest if the verdict it reads says what was actually checked.

**What crosses** — the reviewer's verdict, and the merged pull request that carries it. The verdict itself: approved, or changes requested. The findings, each with a severity, so the record can tell a note from a blocker. And the result of the check against the product's own specification — whether the change conforms to it, drifts from it, contradicts it, or reveals that the specification itself is now stale.

**The hand-off is malformed when** — the verdict is absent or unclear, when a finding carries no severity, or when the specification check is simply not stated. A verdict comment missing any of the three is not posted; the reviewer revises it first. "Looks good" is the failure this seam was written against: it tells the record nothing about what was examined, and close-out then has the choice of inventing a field or leaving a hole.

**What it does not carry** — permission to close out an unmerged change. The verdict is not the authorisation; the merge is. Nor does it carry any obligation to re-review: close-out is bookkeeping, not a second opinion, and a merged change is not reopened because the record-keeper would have judged it differently.

**How it physically runs** — the carrier is the verdict comment on the pull request, which becomes a frozen fact once that pull request merges. The verdict line is written bare, on its own line, because it is read by machine as well as by people, and the merge gate requires a clean one. After the merge, close-out reads it from the pull request's own history and copies it into the provenance record. A serious finding that was raised and merged anyway means a deviation was consciously accepted — it is recorded as such, not quietly dropped. A finding that the specification has gone stale becomes a follow-up issue, because it is not a reason to block the merge and must not vanish either.

## Reference

**Status:** active
**Seam:** the hand-off from the Reviewer (producer) to the per-task Archivist (consumer).
**Single source of truth for this seam.** The two role docs do **not** redefine what crosses this boundary — they point here. `aeg-root/roles/reviewer.md` (producer side) and `aeg-root/roles/archivist.md` (consumer side) each reference this file; this file is where the field-by-field hand-off lives, once.

---

## Why this file exists

Close-out is not a mechanical afterthought — it is the step that makes a tranche's history honest. When the Reviewer's verdict is incomplete (no severity tags, no spec-conformance result, no explicit verdict line), the Archivist cannot assemble the provenance block correctly: they cannot distinguish what was reviewed from what was inferred, what was found from what was missed. This contract removes that ambiguity by specifying exactly what the Reviewer's verdict must contain and exactly what the Archivist reads from it.

The failure mode this prevents: an Archivist who assembles a provenance block with fabricated or inferred fields because the Reviewer's comment was vague; or a BLOCKER finding that merged silently because the Archivist didn't know it existed; or a STALE-SPEC finding that disappeared without a follow-up Issue because no one tracked it.

---

## The hand-off carrier

The **Reviewer's verdict comment** on the open (then merged) PR, plus the **merged PR itself**. The verdict comment is the producer's output; the merge is the trigger that authorizes the Archivist to begin close-out. The Archivist reads the verdict from the PR's review history — it is a frozen fact on the PR record.

---

## The contract — field-by-field mapping

Every item the Reviewer produces in the verdict (left) has exactly one obligation for the per-task Archivist (right). A verdict missing any left-column item is malformed — the Reviewer refuses to post it in that state.

| Reviewer produces | per-task Archivist consumes at | What the consumption means |
|---|---|---|
| **Verdict** (`APPROVE` or `REQUEST CHANGES`) | Entry gate | The Archivist only runs close-out on `APPROVE` + merged PRs. A `REQUEST CHANGES` verdict means the task is not done — close-out does not run until the Reviewer posts `APPROVE` and the PR is subsequently merged. |
| **Finding list** with severity tags (`BLOCKER` / `MAJOR` / `MINOR` / `NIT`) | Provenance block assembly | The Archivist includes the verdict and finding count in the provenance block. A `MAJOR` or `BLOCKER` finding that merged despite being raised means a deviation was approved — the Archivist logs it in the provenance block under DANGLING. |
| **Spec-conformance result** (`CONFORMS` / `DRIFTS` / `CONTRADICTS` / `STALE-SPEC`) | Provenance block + pinned lessons Issue | `CONTRADICTS` that merged is a `severity:strategy` flag in the provenance block. `STALE-SPEC` triggers a follow-up Issue (the Archivist opens it if the Developer did not) — it is not a reason to block merge, but it must not disappear. |

**Reading the table:** left is the producer obligation (Reviewer role doc and this contract enforce it), right is the consumer obligation (Archivist role doc and this contract enforce it). The two role docs must not contradict this table.

## Producer obligations (the Reviewer)

- Every finding must carry a severity tag (`BLOCKER`, `MAJOR`, `MINOR`, or `NIT`). A finding without a tag is malformed — the Reviewer revises the comment before the verdict is considered valid.
- The verdict line must be the **first line** of the verdict comment, in the exact format specified by `roles/reviewer.md`: `VERDICT: APPROVE | REQUEST CHANGES`.
- The spec-conformance result must be stated explicitly — `CONFORMS`, `DRIFTS`, `CONTRADICTS`, or `STALE-SPEC`. "Not checked" is not acceptable for Tier 1+ tasks with a named Project.
- A verdict comment missing any of these three elements is malformed. The Reviewer does not post it.
- Append one row to the tranche's token ledger after posting the verdict.

## Consumer obligations (the per-task Archivist)

- Do not run close-out on unmerged PRs. The merge is the authorization signal — confirmed by querying the forge, not by reading a status field.
- Assemble the provenance block from frozen PR facts (brief in PR body, verdict comment, merge metadata) — never fabricate a field whose source fact is absent. A missing source fact is a DANGLING item, not an opportunity to infer.
- Post the provenance block as a comment on the merged PR (the PR is a frozen truth domain once merged; the provenance block is its permanent record).
- **The provenance block comment is the forge-derived coherence signal that downstream roles depend on.** The next Developer to start a task in this tranche checks whether the most-recently-merged task PR carries a provenance block before executing step 0 — its absence is a hard STOP that blocks the next task from starting. Post it completely; a partial or absent block does not satisfy the Developer's entry gate (see `aeg-root/roles/developer.md` and `aeg-root/contracts/brief-developer.md`).
- A `BLOCKER` or `MAJOR` finding present in the verdict of a merged PR means a deviation was approved. Log it in the provenance block under DANGLING and post a new comment on the pinned lessons Issue.
- A `STALE-SPEC` finding in a merged PR must produce a follow-up Issue if the Developer did not already open one. This is the Archivist's responsibility to ensure it happens.
- Append one row to the tranche's token ledger at close-out.

## Changing this contract

A contract changes **as a unit**. You may not change what the Reviewer produces without, in the same change, updating what the per-task Archivist consumes — because the property that makes the seam sound is that the producer's output side is *identical* to the consumer's input side. Concretely:

- A change to this file is a **Tier 3** change: it alters a cross-role contract, so the reasoning belongs in the pull request that makes it, where the reviewer and the close-out both read it.
- The same PR that edits this contract must verify both `aeg-root/roles/reviewer.md` and `aeg-root/roles/archivist.md` still point here and still match the table.
- Never edit one side's role doc to add/drop a hand-off field directly. Add/drop it **here**; the role docs inherit it by reference.

*This contract is the seam. The Reviewer fills the left column; the per-task Archivist drains the right. One source of truth, changed as a unit.*
