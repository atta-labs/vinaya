# Contract: Developer → Reviewer

## The short version

This seam sits between finished work and the review of it. It exists so that an independent reviewer spends the session judging the work rather than verifying that it was ready to be looked at.

**What crosses** — one open pull request, and everything that makes it reviewable. The brief in its body, pasted whole rather than summarised, because it is the statement of intent the diff has to be judged against. The impact tier, which sets how deep the review goes. Green checks: the type checker, the linter, the tests and the documentation gate all passing already, so a failure found in review is the work's, not the environment's. A diff that stayed inside the file surface the brief named. A completed checklist. Every test-plan item an agent can run, actually run, with the real command output posted rather than a claim about it. And every document the brief named, updated in the same change.

**The hand-off is malformed when** — the brief is missing, paraphrased or edited; when the checks are red; when the diff reaches outside the named surface; when a checklist item is ticked without evidence; when a test-plan item is claimed rather than shown; or when a promised document did not move. Each of those sends the change back rather than becoming a review finding, because none of them is a judgement call.

**What it does not carry** — the authority to fix anything. The reviewer reports and the author repairs; the reviewer never edits the code, never merges, and never writes status. It also does not carry a second opinion on taste: a change is judged against its brief, the product's specification, and safety, not against how the reviewer would have written it.

**How it physically runs** — the carrier is the open pull request: the diff, plus the body holding the brief. Coverage of the documents a change must touch is already enforced mechanically before review begins, which is why the reviewer's remaining job is the question no check can answer — whether the update is true, or a no-op edit that silenced the gate without describing the change. The verdict lands as comments on the pull request, with a severity on every finding, and a change cannot merge without a clean one.

## Reference

**Status:** active
**Seam:** the hand-off from the Developer (producer) to the Reviewer (consumer).
**Single source of truth for this seam.** The two role docs do **not** redefine what crosses this boundary — they point here. `aeg-root/roles/developer.md` (producer side) and `aeg-root/roles/reviewer.md` (consumer side) each reference this file; this file is where the field-by-field hand-off lives, once.

---

## Why this file exists

A review is only as good as the artifact it reviews. When the Developer hands off an incomplete, CI-failing, or brief-free PR, the Reviewer's independence is wasted — they spend the session verifying basics rather than judging correctness and spec-conformance. This contract removes ambiguity about what "ready for review" means: the Developer cannot open a PR without satisfying the left column; the Reviewer cannot start without verifying the right column.

The failure mode this prevents: a Reviewer who begins reviewing a diff without reading the brief (and therefore judges code rather than intent), or who reviews a red-CI PR (and cannot distinguish the Developer's errors from pre-existing failures), or who accepts a PR that touched files outside the brief's surface map without flagging it as a BLOCKER.

---

## The hand-off carrier

The **open PR** — the diff plus the PR body, which carries the brief verbatim. The PR is the Reviewer's primary artifact. The brief (in the PR body) is the intent document; the diff is the execution; the Reviewer's job is to judge whether the execution matched the intent, safely and correctly.

---

## The contract — field-by-field mapping

Every item the Developer produces in the open PR (left) has exactly one obligation for the Reviewer (right). A PR missing any left-column item is not ready for review — the Reviewer refuses to start and sends it back to the Developer.

| Developer produces in the PR | Reviewer consumes at | What the consumption means |
|---|---|---|
| **Brief in PR body** (the frozen brief, pasted verbatim) | Entry — read before looking at the diff | The Reviewer reads the brief first to understand intent, boundary, surface map, and traps. Reviewing a diff without the brief is not a valid review pass. |
| **Tier:** field in PR body | Determines review depth | Tier 0 → light pass; Tier 1 → standard including spec-conformance; Tier 3 → full including spec and state doc verification. |
| **CI green** (typecheck, lint, tests, `verify-docs`) | Entry gate | The Reviewer does not start if CI is red. A red CI is a Developer problem, not a Reviewer finding. |
| **Surface map respected** (diff touches only files named in the brief's surface map) | First diff check | If the diff touches files outside the surface map, that is a BLOCKER finding before reading any logic. |
| **Task Done checklist ticked** | Confirms Developer self-checked | The Reviewer verifies the checklist is present and ticked. An unticked item that the Reviewer then finds broken is a MAJOR finding. |
| **`[agent]` Test Plan items run with evidence comment** | Confirms runtime verification | The Reviewer checks that actual command output was posted for every `[agent]` item. Missing evidence = unticked item = MAJOR finding. |
| **Documentation-update list honored** (every named doc updated in the diff) | Doc coupling check — first diff step after surface-map check | A named doc absent from the diff or present but incorrect is a BLOCKER (it is a DoD obligation, not guidance). `verify-docs` gates structural presence; the Reviewer gates content correctness. |
| **`.vinaya/doc-owners` coverage (C5) satisfied** — every binding fired by the diff is bound (in-diff doc), URL-acked (`Doc-ack: <pointer> — <note>`), or waived by an actor-verified `vinaya/waiver:docs` label applied by a principal. | Coverage check — *mechanical* via CI; the Reviewer reads it as already-true and moves on. | Coverage presence is mechanical (`verify-docs` C5 fails CI if missing). The Reviewer's job shrinks to **judging correctness of the covered doc**: a passing C5 plus an incorrect / no-op / misleading doc update is still a BLOCKER. A waiver is no longer the author's to grant — it is an actor-verified `vinaya/waiver:docs` label applied by a principal, so there is no deferral line for the Reviewer to judge. The seam is dormant when `.vinaya/doc-owners` is absent or no binding matches; in that case there is nothing for either side to do. |

**Reading the table:** left is the producer obligation (Developer role doc and this contract enforce it), right is the consumer obligation (Reviewer role doc and this contract enforce it). The two role docs must not contradict this table.

## Producer obligations (the Developer)

- ~~**Prior-archival precondition satisfied.**~~ **SUPERSEDED (2026-07-13).** This is no longer a Developer producer obligation — the per-task archival / row-adjacency precondition formerly defined in `aeg-root/contracts/brief-developer.md` is removed as a hard-STOP; automated post-merge provenance posting made the drift signal it protected moot.
- **Documentation-update list honored.** Every doc named in the list must be updated in the diff before opening the PR. A PR with list items outstanding is not ready for review; do not open it and expect the Reviewer to discover the gap.
- **`.vinaya/doc-owners` coverage satisfied.** For every binding fired by the diff: update the bound doc in this PR; or, for URL bindings, add `Doc-ack: <pointer> — <note>`; or have a principal apply the actor-verified `vinaya/waiver:docs` label — you cannot self-serve it, and there is no body-field waiver grammar anymore. `verify-docs` C5 enforces this mechanically — if it fails CI, do not request review.
- CI must be green before requesting review. Do not request review with a red CI and expect the Reviewer to begin.
- The brief must be in the PR body, unmodified — pasted verbatim, not summarized or paraphrased.
- The diff must touch only files in the brief's Technical Surface Map. Files outside it are a stop-and-escalate before opening the PR, not a finding for the Reviewer to catch.
- The Task Done checklist must be ticked — all items, with actual verification evidence for each.
- Every `[agent]` Test Plan item must have an evidence comment posted on the PR — the actual command output, not a paraphrase.
- One row appended to the tranche's token ledger before opening the PR.

## Consumer obligations (the Reviewer)

- Read the brief before the diff. This is not optional — the brief is the intent document; the diff without the brief is just code.
- Do not start if CI is red. Post a comment: *"CI is red — returning to Developer. Start review once CI is green."*
- Check surface map compliance as the first diff-inspection step. A surface map violation is a BLOCKER before any logic review.
- **Verify documentation-update-list compliance as a BLOCKER gate.** For every doc named in the list, confirm it appears in the diff AND is correct (not just present — `verify-docs` already checks presence). A named doc absent from the diff or present but wrong is a BLOCKER finding before reviewing logic. This is a hard gate, not an advisory; the list is a DoD commitment.
- **Judge correctness of `.vinaya/doc-owners` coverage.** Coverage *presence* is mechanical — `verify-docs` C5 has already enforced it (or the PR would not be green). Your job is to read each in-diff doc update that satisfied a C5 binding and confirm it actually reflects the code change, not a no-op edit or misleading rewrite that silenced the gate. A passing C5 + an incorrect doc update is a BLOCKER. A doc-coverage waiver is no longer a body field you weigh: it exists only as an actor-verified `vinaya/waiver:docs` label applied by a principal, which is a forge-authenticated human act rather than a parseable string.
- Produce a structured verdict per `roles/reviewer.md` output format — with severity tags on every finding. A verdict without severity tags is malformed.
- Do not edit the code. Do not expand scope. Do not approve to be agreeable.
- Append one row to the tranche's token ledger after posting the verdict (and again on each re-review after `CHANGES_REQUESTED`).

## Changing this contract

A contract changes **as a unit**. You may not change what the Developer produces without, in the same change, updating what the Reviewer consumes — because the property that makes the seam sound is that the producer's output side is *identical* to the consumer's input side. Concretely:

- A change to this file is a **Tier 3** change: it alters a cross-role contract, so the reasoning belongs in the pull request that makes it, where the reviewer and the close-out both read it.
- The same PR that edits this contract must verify both `aeg-root/roles/developer.md` and `aeg-root/roles/reviewer.md` still point here and still match the table.
- Never edit one side's role doc to add/drop a hand-off field directly. Add/drop it **here**; the role docs inherit it by reference.

*This contract is the seam. The Developer fills the left column; the Reviewer drains the right. One source of truth, changed as a unit.*
