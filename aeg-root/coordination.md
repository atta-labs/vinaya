# Coordination — How to Work With This System

**This file lives in the repo at `aeg-root/coordination.md`.**
**All agents read this at session start.**

This is the coordination contract for **this repo's instance** of the AEG operating model. (The model itself is neutral and lives in `state-machine.md`, `aeg-manual-flow.md`, `tranche-model.md`, the role docs, and the `aeg` skill; *this* file fills in the repo-specific parts: the names, the products, the tools in use, the house communication style. A different repo adopting AEG would keep the model and replace this file's specifics.)

Dani works with multiple agents across a chat/planning surface and a coding-agent surface. This file tells each agent who it is, how to orient, and what the rules are.

**The model described here is Agentic Execution Governance (AEG)** — the v3 operational model. AEG is a small set of accountable roles (Principal, Planner / Brief Author, Developer, Reviewer, Archivist) coordinating AI agents through briefs, blocking escalation, and independent review. It is *not* "project management" (there is no product plan, timeline, or resource tracking here — that stays in the company's tool) — it is governance plus orchestration of delegated AI execution.

**AEG is forge-native, orchestrator-independent.** It depends on a Git forge (GitHub) as its source of truth for execution state — task status is *derived* from Issue/branch/PR/merge state, never stored. It does **not** depend on any orchestration tool. The governance half (authority, ratification, review) lives in this repo, not in any tool.

---

## Reading order for new sessions

If you are starting a fresh session and need to orient:

1. `aeg-root/coordination.md` — this file (start here)
2. `aeg-root/state-machine.md` — the constitution; artifact states, roles, permissions, decision schema
3. `aeg-root/roles/{your-role}.md` — Planner / Brief Author (incl. Planner & Brief Author modes), Developer, Principal, Reviewer, Security, or Archivist
4. `aeg-root/tranche-model.md` — the tranche model: tasks-as-Issues, forge-derived status, the thin topology file, conflicts (read when planning or executing)
5. **Per-project state (pinned Issues)** — what is true right now, per project (one pinned Issue each, found via the repo's native Pinned Issues view, not a memorized number) plus the ecosystem-wide bucket (every project with no dedicated folder, plus cross-project facts, its own pinned Issue). Non-derivable operational facts; current focus pointer.
6. **Derive current execution state from the forge** — see the "Session-start forge queries" section below
7. `aeg-root/tranches/<name>.md` — the current tranche's task topology (the plan); live status is queried from the forge, not read here. **Post-cutover:** most active tranches no longer have this file at all — task→Issue topology derives straight from the forge (a Milestone + `tranche:<slug>`-labeled Issues). **No active tranche carries this file at all today** — the last tracked exception's file was deleted once its backfill completed (`tranche-model.md` §4); `completed/` tranches keep theirs permanently, by design, and `check-no-disk-state.ts` now CI-blocks adding a new active one.
8. **Lessons log (pinned Issue)** — calibration lessons + anti-patterns, one comment per lesson (read when authoring briefs or post-mortems)

The AEG model front door is the **`aeg`** skill (the model in one read) → the **`aeg-roles`** skill (routes you to your role doc). Load those first; this file is the repo-specific companion.

### One AEG model, at the root. Always orient from there.

There is exactly one AEG model in this monorepo, at the repo-root `aeg-root/` (constitution, flow, roles, skills, the project registry `projects.md`). It exists nowhere else. **Any agent, executing any task for any project — an app, a package, a library, the monorepo itself — orients from `aeg-root/` first:** it reads the constitution, the role doc, and the active tranche there. It never expects a per-project copy of the model.

Living **state** is held in pinned forge Issues (lessons, per-project operational state): one root ecosystem-wide pinned Issue (covering every project with no dedicated folder, plus cross-project facts) and one pinned Issue per project that has its own folder. A task updates the pinned state Issue of each project it touches (one for a single-project task, several for a cross-project task — resolve which project via `.vinaya/projects.md`, then which Issue via this list or `gh issue search`). This state layer holds facts only — never the model — which is what forces every agent back to `aeg-root/` for the rules.

For deeper context on the operational model design:
- `aeg-root/aeg-manual-flow.md` — running the flow by hand (the operator's guide)
- `aeg-root/process.md` — the thirteen-phase walkthrough from idea to merged code
- `aeg-root/diagrams/` — process and architecture diagrams (note: being brought in line with the forge-derived-status model; if a diagram shows agents writing status, the prose docs are canonical)

Do not generate strategy, plan a tranche, or author briefs until you have read `state-machine.md` and the spec for any project in scope.

### Session-start forge queries — deriving current state

`now.md` is retired. Current execution state is **derived from the forge**, not read from a file. Run these queries to answer the three orientation questions:

**"What's active?"** — open Issues with an `tranche:<slug>` label, or check open PRs:
```bash
gh issue list --label "tranche:<slug>" --state open
gh pr list --state open
```

**"What's next?"** — open Issues in the current tranche that have no open PR (unassigned branch):
```bash
gh issue list --label "tranche:<slug>" --state open --assignee ""
# Then for each: gh pr list --state open | grep "task/<slug>/"
```

**"What's blocked?"** — Issues with the `aeg:blocked` label:
```bash
gh issue list --label "aeg:blocked" --state open
```

**"What's the current focus?"** — read the ecosystem pinned state Issue's "Current focus" section and the active tranche file at `aeg-root/tranches/<name>.md`.

**"What merged recently?"** — `gh pr list --state merged --limit 20`

No brief, no audit finding, no "next steps" recommendation is valid without this forge check. Forge state > file state > memory. Always.

---

## The coordination model — four truth domains

Every fact lives in exactly one place (see `tranche-model.md` §1):

- **The Git forge** (Issue / branch / PR / review / merge state) = **all live execution status, derived not stored.** Authoritative for task status and merge state. A task *is* a forge Issue.
- **Repo** = code, specs, skills, PM docs, role docs, the thin tranche topology files, design decisions. Git-tracked, long-lived, changed by commits/PRs. The source of truth for *plan and governance* (not live status).
- **The PR body** = the just-in-time brief — a task's full execution context. The brief is pasted here at PR-open, never committed separately, never in the Issue.
- **Local filesystem** = orchestration-tool runtime state, worktrees, dev servers. Ephemeral. Never canonical.

Conversation logs / thinking are not artifacts; do not cite as authority.

### PM files that change frequently

| File | Purpose | Update cadence |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `aeg-root/coordination.md` | This file. Rules, names, how to work. | Rare (system changes only) |
| Per-project state (pinned Issue) | Non-derivable operational facts: known production issues, env-var requirements, phase intent, pending manual ops, current-focus pointer. | Whenever state changes |
| `aeg-root/tranches/<name>.md` | The current tranche's task topology (edges, grouping). Plan only — no status. | At plan time (Planner) |
| Lessons log (pinned Issue) | Calibration lessons + anti-patterns. One new comment per lesson. | Monthly review |
| `docs-index.md` | Discovery map of repo content. Auto-generated. | When repo files added/removed/renamed |

> **`now.md` is retired.** Active work, blocked tasks, and next candidates are derived from the forge (see "Session-start forge queries" above). The forge is the single source of truth for what is happening; the per-project pinned state Issue holds what the forge cannot derive.

The roadmap is **not** an AEG file — it lives in the company's tool (or, for solo work, in the per-project backlogs `apps/<project>/specs/<project>-backlog.md`, which are reference docs out of the flow). The old global `roadmap.md` is retired, and the monorepo-wide `specs/ecosystem-backlog.md` it once sat beside was deleted with the rest of the stale AEG research — cross-cutting items are cut as backlog Issues instead. **Backlog convention:** a unit's *plan* lives in its `specs/` (`apps/<project>/specs/<project>-backlog.md` per project); a unit's *flow + governance* lives in the root `aeg-root/` (model, exists once); its *living state* lives on the per-project pinned Issue (the old per-unit `aeg-project/` state folder is retired).

### What lives in the repo

Everything else. All skills (canonical home `aeg-root/skills/*/SKILL.md`, with a generated agent-surface view e.g. `.claude/skills/`), agent definitions, specs (`apps/*/specs/*.md`), role docs, the state machine, this file. The index (`docs-index.md`) lists where things are.

---

## The names — where the host repo defines them

Every session needs a shared vocabulary for the products, brands, and domains the work touches. **That vocabulary is the host repo's, not this model's**, so it is not defined here.

An earlier revision carried one repo's product table, brand architecture, and naming conventions inline, marked as instance content. Marking it was not enough: a repo adopting this model still received another organization's product names, domains, and house naming rules as part of its own doctrine. The section is now a pointer rather than a payload.

**Where to look, in order:** the project registry (`.vinaya/projects.md` — the authority for valid `Project:` values, and the only names any gate resolves against), then the repo's own root guidance file for brand and naming conventions. A repo with a single project needs neither: one project, no disambiguation, no registry.

Nothing in this model resolves a product name. Names route work to specs and state; the routing is registry-driven, and the registry is the adopter's.

## Session start protocol

Role is determined by environment and context — not by which agent you are. Read `state-machine.md` Section 1 for the role determination rules.

### If you are the Planner / Brief Author (a chat/planning surface, talking strategy/planning)

1. **Read `state-machine.md`** — confirm the authority matrix and decision schema.
2. **Read `roles/planner.md` or `roles/brief-author.md`** — confirm which of the two you are. Planning a tranche is the Planner; authoring one task's brief is the Brief Author.
3. **Read the ecosystem pinned state Issue** — orient on current ecosystem state, known production issues, and pending manual ops; read the relevant per-project pinned Issue too if scoped to one project. Read the current `tranches/<name>.md` for in-flight task topology.
4. **Derive live execution state from the forge** — run the session-start forge queries above: open Issues by `tranche:<slug>`, open PRs, `aeg:blocked` labels.
5. **Check the `needs:principal-input` label** — any labeled Issues/PRs for today's window? (`gh issue list --label needs:principal-input --state open`, `gh pr list --label needs:principal-input --state open` retired the `ratification-queue.md` file in favor of this label query — historical entries preserved on the pinned ratification Issue.)
6. **Determine the project in scope** — apply the spec-check gate (below) before anything substantive.

### If you are the Developer (a coding-agent surface, executing a brief)

1. **Read the brief completely** before writing any code.
2. **Read `roles/developer.md`** — confirm the entry gate, tier, stop conditions, verification checklist.
3. **Check the dispatch gates against the forge** — is every `depends-on` task's PR merged? Is any `conflicts-with` sibling's PR open? If a gate isn't satisfied, STOP (the task serializes).
4. **Create the worktree** — Step 0, branch `task/<tranche>/<n>` from `origin/main`. Do this before anything else:
   ```
   git worktree add .worktrees/task/<tranche>/<n> -b task/<tranche>/<n> origin/main && cd .worktrees/task/<tranche>/<n> && bun install --frozen-lockfile --silent
   ```
   The `bun install` step initializes Husky, which fires the post-checkout hook (`tools/sync-env-from-main.sh`) to symlink `.env*.local` files from the main checkout.
5. **Run remaining pre-flight** — `git status`, `git log --oneline -3`, confirm the branch.
6. **Identify which skills apply** — the brief's scope determines which skills to invoke.
7. **Do not begin implementation** until gates are clear, worktree exists, pre-flight passes, skill-check is satisfied.

### If you are the Reviewer or Security agent (reviewing an open PR)

You were invoked specifically to review a PR. You run with fresh context on purpose; you did not write this code.

1. **Read your role doc** — `roles/reviewer.md` (code) or `roles/security.md` (security). It is your full spec, including the entry-gate refusals.
2. **Read the brief — in the PR body** (not the Issue; the Developer pastes the brief into the PR description). If there's no open PR, or no brief in the PR body, refuse per your role doc.
3. **Read the PR diff** — `git diff main...HEAD` (stat first, then substantive files).
5. **Emit the VERDICT block** from your role doc. Do not edit code. Do not merge. Do not write status. Route `[ESCALATE]` findings to Planner/Principal.

### If you are the Archivist (closing out a merged PR)

1. **Confirm the PR is merged** — your only hard precondition (forge-derived). If not merged, refuse.
2. **Read `roles/archivist.md`** — the close-out checklist.
3. **Work the checklist** — Issue closed, docs coherent, per-project pinned state Issue updated for every project the task listed (remove stale operational notes; `now.md` no longer exists), provenance block posted to the merged PR. Flag (don't perform) orphaned branches and worktree removal. Write no task status — the merge is the status.

### Mandatory forge check (before any brief, audit, or recommendation)

Run or fetch before producing output that depends on knowing what's in flight:
- Open Issues (current tranche): `gh issue list --label "tranche:<slug>" --state open`
- Open PRs: `gh pr list --state open`
- Blocked Issues: `gh issue list --label "aeg:blocked" --state open`
- Recent merges: `gh pr list --state merged --limit 20`

No brief, no audit finding, no "next steps" recommendation is valid without this.
Forge state > file state > memory. Always.

### Hard rule — the spec-check gate

If Dani asks a strategic, architectural, or product-shape question about a named product, and you have not read the specs for that product, **stop and read them first.** No "thinking out loud first." Applies to the Planner and the Brief Author alike. Does NOT apply when executing a brief (the brief specifies scope; do not expand it).

---

## Ratification windows

1-2 daily sessions where the Principal resolves items requiring his final authority. there is no queue file — the Brief Author applies the `needs:principal-input` label to whichever Issue/PR needs ratification and batches the labeled set (`gh issue list --label needs:principal-input`, `gh pr list --label needs:principal-input`) before each window. Historical entries predating this mechanism are preserved on the pinned ratification Issue.

**Batches at windows:** Type 1 decisions (irreversible; PENDING until window); Tier 3 PR merges; `severity: product` escalations; PENDING Type 2 decisions.

**Does NOT wait:** Type 2 decisions the Brief Author makes (ACTIVE immediately); Tier 0/1 PR merges (after CI + Brief Author spec review); `severity: execution`/`strategy` escalations (Brief Author handles); already-ratified items.

**Brief Author responsibility:** before each window, surface PENDING items; after, mark RESOLVED with the Principal's action and date.

---

## Spec naming convention

Locked. Spec filenames are `{product}-spec.md` or `{component}-spec.md` — no `-v0`/`-v1`/`-draft`/date suffixes. Version state lives in the file's `Status:` block (`draft` / `target` / `ratified` / `retired`), not the filename. Renaming to add a version suffix requires a lock challenge to.

---

## Coordination rules — keeping sessions in sync

### Every repo-file change goes through a worktree + PR — no direct commits to `main`

**Universal rule, every role.** Any change to a repo-tracked file — code, specs, skills, role docs, the tranche topology — reaches `main` through a worktree branch + PR + green merge. **No role commits or pushes directly to `main`.** This applies to the Planner editing the tranche file just as much as the Developer editing code: "I only touched a doc" is not an exemption. The drift that produced this rule was a plan commit landing on `main` with no worktree and nothing stopping it.

This is **mechanically enforced**, not merely asked:
- `.husky/pre-commit` refuses a commit while the current branch is `main`; `.husky/pre-push` refuses any push whose target is `refs/heads/main`. (Husky activates per-worktree via the post-checkout hook, so the guards fire in every worktree.)
- The merge-gate hook `.claude/hooks/check-pr-green.sh` (a `PreToolUse` hook wired in `.claude/settings.json`, sibling to `check-skill.sh`) intercepts every agent merge path — `gh pr merge`, `gh api …/merge`, `curl …/merge`, and the GitHub MCP `merge_pull_request` tool — and **denies the merge unless `gh pr checks <pr>` is all-green**. A red or pending PR cannot be merged by an agent. The gate fails closed: if greenness can't be proven, the merge is denied.

The green-merge + no-direct-commit invariants now live in both these hooks and a GitHub setting: repository ruleset `17656829` ("Main protection") requires the `AEG gate suite`, `Typecheck + unit tests`, and `Review gate` checks on `~DEFAULT_BRANCH`, with `bypass_actors: []`. The exception path is the same as everywhere: a `Lock`/override is a Principal action, not an agent one.

The only thing a non-Developer role does *not* route through a worktree is a pure forge action (cutting an Issue, posting a comment, merging via the gate) — those touch the forge, not repo files. Every repo *file* edit goes through the worktree + PR.

### When state changes, update the pinned state Issue

State changes: a project phase advances, an app ships/scaffolds, auth/DNS config changes, a known production issue is resolved, a pending manual op is completed. The Brief Author updates the relevant project's pinned state Issue (one per project, or the ecosystem-wide one) directly (editing an Issue body is a forge action, not a repo-file change — it does not go through a worktree/PR). For Tier 3 work affecting the state Issue, note it in the code PR's body too.

Active work, next candidates, and blocked tasks are **derived from the forge** — they are never written to a file. (`now.md` is retired.)

### When the plan changes, update the appropriate file

- **The execution plan changes** (a task's edges, a new task, tranche scope) → the current `tranches/<name>.md` (Planner, at plan time). Live task *status* is never written — it's derived from the forge.
- **Held/future project items change** → the relevant per-project backlog (`apps/<project>/specs/<project>-backlog.md`) — out of the flow.
- **Lesson learned / anti-pattern** → post a new comment on the pinned lessons Issue — never edit an existing comment

### When repo structure changes, regenerate `docs-index.md`

Run `bun docs:index`, commit the result. On add/remove/rename. Content changes within existing files do not require regeneration.

### When decisions are made, log them immediately

State the decision in the pull request that carries the work, during the conversation. Announce: "I'm treating this as a Type [1/2] decision." Do not defer to session end.

## What goes where — quick reference

| If you're updating... | Where |
|----------------------|-------|
| A skill / agent definition | Repo only (skills: canonical in `aeg-root/skills/`, generated view in `.claude/skills/`) |
| A project spec, ecosystem vision, naming decision | Repo only |
| Non-derivable operational facts (production issues, env-var requirements, phase intent, pending manual ops, current-focus pointer) | Per-project pinned Issue, one per project, plus one covering ecosystem-wide facts |
| The execution plan (task topology, edges) | `aeg-root/tranches/<name>.md` |
| Held / future project items | `apps/{project}/specs/{project}-backlog.md` (per project); cross-cutting items are cut as backlog Issues |
| Completed work history | `git log` / merged-PR history (redundant with a committed changelog, so none is kept) |
| Calibration lessons + anti-patterns | Pinned lessons Issue, one new comment per lesson |
| Items awaiting Principal ratification | `needs:principal-input` label on the relevant Issue/PR; historical record on the pinned ratification Issue |
| Live task status (what's active, blocked, next) | **Nowhere — derived from the forge** (`gh issue list --label "tranche:<slug>"`, `gh pr list`, Issues view) |
| Adding/removing/renaming a repo file | Repo + `bun docs:index` |
| Fundamental coordination rules | This file |

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Reading or writing `roadmap.md` — it's retired; the execution plan is the tranche file, the product roadmap is the company's tool / backlogs (`apps/*/specs/*-backlog.md`)
- ❌ Putting a backlog anywhere but a `specs/` folder — the plan lives in `specs/`; `aeg-root/` is the model, flow + governance only, and living state is the per-project pinned Issue
- ❌ Writing task status anywhere (a file, the tranche topology, an Issue field) — status is derived from the forge; storing it recreates the racing status model the design eliminated
- ❌ Adding execution metadata (status, PR #, dates) to the tranche topology file — it is plan topology only (`tranche-model.md` §9)
- ❌ Putting the brief in the Issue — the brief is just-in-time and lives in the PR body; the Issue is task identity + metadata only
- ❌ Putting planning metadata (priority, estimates, points) on an Issue — that's the company's roadmap, not AEG
- ❌ Building a dynamic conflict scanner — declare conflicts conservatively and serialize (`tranche-model.md` §9)
- ❌ Putting tactical day-to-day plans in project specs (commit churn)
- ❌ Pretending to have read a spec that isn't in context — ask for it by exact path, or read it from the forge
- ❌ Restating the host repo's brand, namespace, or product-naming rules here — they belong to the adopting repo, not to this model
- ❌ Letting the Developer review its own work — review/security passes are separate fresh-context invocations
- ❌ Generating strategy or planning a tranche before reading the specs (spec-check gate)
- ❌ Adding version suffixes to spec filenames (locked)
- ❌ Making a Type 1 decision in the Brief Author's absence without flagging PENDING
- ❌ Logging decisions at session end instead of at the moment of decision
- ❌ Letting PENDING items accumulate without surfacing them at the next window

## Communication style with Dani

- Terse. No preamble.
- No time-of-day, energy, or wellness framing.
- No reflexive caveats unless risk is concrete.
- Direct recommendations, not balanced both-sides answers.
- Match length to substance.
- Don't repeat back what Dani said.
- Push back when warranted. Don't manufacture criticism when a position is sound.
- Diagnose before iterating — find root cause before proposing fixes.
- Project files are authoritative when they conflict with memory.

---

## Multi-agent context

Dani works with multiple AI collaborators simultaneously: Claude (multiple sessions), Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek, ChatGPT. Dani is always the Principal.

When other AI outputs are pasted in, Claude responds as the adversarial reviewer / Critic. Synthesis across multiple AI views is part of the working pattern — the manual version of what Vāda automates.

The AEG model formalizes this: Principal → Planner → Brief Author → Developer → Reviewer + Security → merge → Archivist. The Brief Author routes escalations by severity. Agents do not make final calls.

**Tooling note (this repo, May 2026):** GitHub MCP may be available via OAuth in fresh conversations — prefer it over paste-back for reading repo content and creating Issues/PRs. The coding-agent surface has direct filesystem access to the worktree. Self-hosted MCP servers with bearer-token auth (e.g. Vāda's hosted MCP) work via a coding-agent CLI, not via the chat connector broker. An orchestration tool may bind the same conversational surface (list active tasks, reply to a blocked task) — a convenience of whatever tool is in use, never part of the model.
