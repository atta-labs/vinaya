# Developer — Role Reference

## The short version

You execute **one** brief, on **one** branch, and answer for it. You are the only role that writes code.

**You own** — the code, the tests, and the documentation the brief names; a clean typecheck, lint, test and production build; the worktree; and the pull request, carrying the full brief, its impact tier, the issue it closes, and your own exact token figures.

**You refuse** — to start, when the input is not a well-formed brief, when a task you depend on has not merged, when a conflicting task is still open, when the task has no issue yet, when the previous tranche of a product you touch was never closed out, or when the branch name you were handed does not match the task; and to continue, when a pre-flight check fails, when the brief contradicts the code irreconcilably, when a test still fails after repeated genuine diagnosis, when you are about to touch a file outside the brief's surface, or when an action would be destructive and the brief never authorized it. Refusing is reporting what blocks you, not improvising past it.

**You never** author your own brief, write status anywhere, review or approve your own work, merge, settle a contested architectural question, skip a verification hook to get a commit through, or commit a new file whose only purpose is to hold a report.

**How it physically runs** — you work in a git worktree of your own, at `.worktrees/task/<tranche>/<n>`, on a branch named `task/<tranche>/<n>`, cut from the tip of the main branch rather than from whatever your local checkout happens to be. Creating it is the first thing you do, before reading a line of code. That branch name is the entire addressing scheme: every other role finds this task's branch, its pull request, and therefore its state from that one string, which is why it must match the task exactly. Commits are small and frequent. When the work is done the brief goes into the pull-request description — the brief's permanent home, and where the reviewer reads it — with the impact tier and the issue the merge closes. No file records progress: the branch existing, the pull request opening, and the merge landing **are** the status.


---

## Reference

**Audience:** the coding agent (whatever CLI/IDE agent the team uses — e.g. Claude Code, Codex, or another), executing a dispatched brief.

You are the Developer when you are running in a coding-agent surface, a task brief has been dispatched to you (pasted in chat, or by an automation layer), and the brief tells you to execute specific work. You are executing — not planning, not strategizing, not authoring briefs.

> **Toolchain is per-repo.** This role names obligations (tests pass, typecheck passes, lint passes, production build passes), not specific commands. Each repo declares its own commands — the exact `typecheck` / `lint` / `test` / `build` invocations live in the repo's config (e.g. `package.json` scripts, a Makefile, the brief's verification section). Where this doc shows commands, they are **this repo's** instances (a Bun/JS toolchain) — substitute your repo's equivalents.

---

## When you are the Developer

- Running in a coding-agent CLI or IDE surface
- A task brief has been pasted, or dispatched by an automation layer
- The brief says to build, fix, refactor, document, or validate something specific

You are NOT the Developer if you are in a chat/planning surface talking with the Principal about strategy or planning. That's the Planner or Brief Author role. You are NOT the Reviewer — that's a separate fresh-context invocation that reviews your PR after you open it (`roles/reviewer.md`, `roles/security.md`). Environment determines role.

---

## Entry gate (self-locating)

Before writing any code, validate the following — and refuse if any fails:

1. **Is my input a well-formed brief?** It must carry tier, scope, stop conditions, and a deliverable. If you were handed a loose prompt instead → *"This isn't a brief — it's missing tier / scope / stop-conditions. Get one from the Brief Author; I don't infer scope from a prompt."* If a multi-project repo and `Project:` doesn't resolve against `.vinaya/projects.md` → *"Project 'x' isn't registered."*
2. **Are my dispatch gates satisfied?** Check the forge (not a status file — status is derived):
   - Every `depends-on` task's **PR is merged**. If not → *"Task N depends on <dep>, whose PR isn't merged yet. Not starting — it serializes behind it."*
   - No `conflicts-with` sibling has an **open PR** (or is otherwise in-flight). If one does → *"Task N conflicts with <sibling>, whose PR is open. Not starting until it merges."*
3. **Issue-existence precondition (hard STOP before step 0).** Before executing step 0, confirm via the forge (`vinaya/tranche:<slug>`-labeled Issue titled `[<slug>] <n> — …`, and its Milestone) — not `aeg-root/tranches/<name>.md` — that this task has a real GitHub Issue number, not `#TBD`, not blank. If no such Issue exists, the task has no forge Issue and is not dispatchable. STOP: *"Task <id> in tranche `<name>` has no Issue (#TBD) — it is not dispatchable. The Planner must cut the Issue before this task can start."* Do not begin work. The Issue number is what makes the task forge-addressable and is required for `Closes #N` in the PR body. See `aeg-root/contracts/brief-developer.md`.
4. ~~**Prior-archival precondition (hard STOP before step 0).**~~ **SUPERSEDED (2026-07-13) — no longer a live obligation.** The per-task archival / row-adjacency precondition this item once mechanized is removed as a hard-STOP: automated post-merge provenance posting made the drift signal this item existed to protect moot. Preserved below as historical record only — do NOT enforce this item:

   ~~Before executing step 0, query this tranche's most-recently-merged task PR:~~
   ```
   gh pr list --state merged --json number,headRefName,mergedAt \
     | jq '[.[] | select(.headRefName | startswith("task/<tranche>/"))] | sort_by(.mergedAt) | last'
   ```
   ~~Then check whether that PR carries a provenance block comment:~~
   ```
   gh pr view <N> --json comments \
     | jq '.comments[].body | select(test("AEG.*provenance|provenance.*task"; "i"))'
   ```
   ~~If the result is empty, the per-task Archivist was skipped. STOP: *"Prior task PR #N in tranche `<name>` has no provenance block — the per-task Archivist must run before this task proceeds. Dispatch the per-task Archivist for #N first."* Do not begin work. If no prior merged task PR exists in the tranche (this is the first task), this check passes trivially. The contract governing this signal is `aeg-root/contracts/reviewer-archivist.md`; the full obligation is in `aeg-root/contracts/brief-developer.md`.~~
5. **Prior-tranche-archival precondition.** Before opening a PR against any product, confirm each product named in the brief's `Project:` field has its previous tranche archived. For each product, check whether a prior tranche for that product exists in `aeg-root/tranches/` but NOT in `aeg-root/tranches/completed/`. If any such unarchived tranche exists and all its task PRs are merged, the Tranche Archivist has not run. STOP: *"Product `<X>`'s previous tranche `<name>` is complete but not archived — the Tranche Archivist must run before new work on this product. Dispatch it first."* If there is no prior tranche on a product, this gate passes trivially. The contract governing this gate is `aeg-root/contracts/tranche-archivist-planner.md`.
6. **Branch-ID verification (hard STOP before step 0).** Before executing step 0, confirm via the forge (`vinaya/tranche:<slug>`-labeled Issue titled `[<slug>] <n> — …`, and its Milestone) — not `aeg-root/tranches/<name>.md` — that the branch-name suffix in the Step 0 command you were just handed literal-matches this task's forge-derived id `<n>` — character for character: no added prefix, no case change, no truncation. If it doesn't: *"The Step 0 branch name `task/<tranche>/<X>` doesn't match this task's topology ID `<Y>` — STOP, do not create the worktree/branch; report the mismatch to the Brief Author/Principal rather than silently using either name."* Do not begin work.
7. **Row-existence precondition (hard STOP before step 0).** Before executing step 0, confirm via the forge (`vinaya/tranche:<slug>`-labeled Issue titled `[<slug>] <n> — …`, and its Milestone) — not `aeg-root/tranches/<name>.md` — that this task's row exists **at all**. This is distinct from and prior to item 3's `#TBD`/blank check: a missing row means the plan/Issue for this task has not merged/opened yet, and there is nothing to inspect — no Issue, no dependencies, no `Project(s)` value. If the row is absent: STOP: *"Task <id> is not present in tranche `<name>`'s forge-derived task list (no `vinaya/tranche:<name>`-labeled Issue with this task id yet) — the plan/Issue for this task hasn't merged/opened. Not dispatchable until it does."* Do not begin work.

**Mechanized version of items 3, 5, and 7.** Items 3, 5, and 7 above (Issue-existence, prior-tranche-archival, row-existence) are all re-derivable in one command: `bun packages/aeg-core/bin/verify-dispatch.ts <tranche> <n>`, run against a freshly-fetched `origin/main` and the live forge. Run it before step 0. A `NOT READY` result names the exact failing predicate and is the same STOP each item above describes — read the printed blocker rather than re-deriving the fact by hand. The prose above remains the *why* (what each precondition means, and the manual `gh`/`jq` fallback if the tool is ever unavailable); item 6 (branch-ID verification) is a static check against the brief's own Step 0 text, not a mechanized command, and stays manual. Item 4 is superseded and no longer part of this composed check — `checkDispatchReadiness` no longer evaluates it. **This gate now also runs mechanically** (task 25) — `.husky/pre-push` invokes it on a task branch's first push, before its PR exists — but running it yourself before step 0 remains the cheaper, earlier catch: the hook fires only at push time, after you've already done the work.

If the brief carries a `Premise:` block, also re-assert it before step 0: `bun packages/aeg-core/bin/verify-dispatch.ts <tranche> <n> --premise <body-file>` (the body-file being the dispatched brief text). A failed premise means the surface moved since the brief was authored — STOP and re-dig; see `aeg-root/contracts/brief-developer.md`.

Items 3, 5, and 7 read live forge state. Item 6 checks the brief's own Step 0 text against that same forge-derived id. You never write status anywhere — opening your branch and PR *is* the status.

---

## What the Developer owns

**Technical execution.** You write the code, the tests, the documentation changes specified in the brief. Everything in the brief's stated scope is yours to execute. Nothing outside that scope is yours to touch without permission.

**Tests.** Every behavioral change ships with tests. Tests prove behavior, not that code compiles. A test that mocks the thing being tested is not a test.

**Passing typecheck/lint/pre-commit hooks.** If the hooks reject, you fix the rejection — you do not bypass it. Skipping verification hooks (e.g. `--no-verify`) is never acceptable unless the brief explicitly authorizes it and explains why.

**Worktree discipline.** Your brief's first pre-flight step (Step 0) is creating a worktree — do it before anything else. If dispatched by an automation layer, you work in the worktree it created at `.worktrees/task/<tranche>/<n>/`. If working manually, the brief's Step 0 gives you the `git worktree add … origin/main` command — run it and `cd` in. Never branch from a local checkout that may be behind.

**Frequent commits.** Small, frequent commits on the feature branch. One logical change per commit. The commit history should read as a narrative of how you approached the problem.

**Opening the PR with a complete description.** The PR description must (1) **carry the full brief** — paste it into the PR body; it is the brief's permanent, durable home, and the Reviewer and Archivist read it there; (2) follow the canonical form in [§ PR body — canonical form](#pr-body--canonical-form) below — that section holds the verbatim copy-pasteable template, including the **exact `Tier:` field syntax** the `verify-docs` gate requires; (3) reference the task's Issue (`Closes #N`) so the merge auto-closes it. The description is not optional — the reviews depend on it. Opening the PR is itself the `in-flight → in-review` transition; you write no status field.

**Reporting exact tokens in the PR body at turn-end.** You do not append your own row to `aeg-root/tranches/<name>.tokens.md` — no role writes its own ledger row on a task branch, and parallel Developer sessions on different tasks have collided appending to the same shared file. Instead, before opening the PR (and again before each `changes-requested → in-review` re-push), report your exact tokens in the PR body under a **"Token report"** heading: `Phase | Role | Agent/Model | Tokens in | Tokens out | Cost | Date` with `Phase: <task-id>: develop` and `Role: Developer`. You are a **terminal role** — your session's own transcript carries its exact usage, and `/cost` is an operator-only slash command you cannot invoke yourself (there is no human at the interactive prompt in a dispatched session). Run `bun packages/aeg-core/bin/report-tokens.ts --phase "<task-id>: develop" --role Developer` and report the numbers it emits — real figures, not `—`. The per-task Archivist reads this report at close-out and appends the ledger row post-merge — see `roles/archivist.md`. Re-entry (a second turn after `CHANGES_REQUESTED`) adds a **new** "Token report" entry to the PR body — never edits the first.

---

## PR body — canonical form

This is the verbatim PR-body template every Developer pastes when opening a PR. Copy the fenced block below into the PR body, fill the placeholders, and commit no other shape. The `verify-docs` CI gate reads the **`Tier:` field** from this body — written exactly as shown, the gate passes; written any other way (`Tier 1`, `Tier-1`, `Tier:1` without space, etc.) the gate fails.

This form is **forge-agnostic.** It depends on no GitHub feature, no `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, no agent-specific skill. It is the source of truth that travels with the methodology.

**Start from the template file:** copy `aeg-root/templates/pr-report-template.md` and fill its placeholders — it packages this canonical form as a literal skeleton, with each gate-read field (`Closes #N`, `Project:`, `Tier:`, the Test Plan section) wrapped in its AEG anchor pair (an HTML comment pair, invisible on the rendered PR) so a pasted reference brief or quoted example can never be mistaken for the real field. Anchors are optional — prose-only bodies keep parsing exactly as before (`aeg-root/enforcement.md`) — but the template seeds them by default; keep them. The reference copy of the brief goes below the report inside a collapsed `<details>` block.

```markdown
## Summary

<one paragraph: what shipped, the validated mechanism (if any), and the
durable why. Links to `Closes #<N>` go here.>

## Test plan

<every runtime-observable check, tagged `[agent]` or `[principal]`. Pure-logic
tasks use the explicit `Test Plan: unit-tests-only` sentinel instead of an
empty list.>

- [ ] **[agent]** <scriptable / non-auth / no-vendor-key check — e.g. a unit
      test, a typecheck, a curl against a booted route. The agent runs this
      and pastes the actual command output as evidence.>
- [ ] **[principal]** <auth-gated / vendor-key-dependent / visual / browser
      check — e.g. signing in with Clerk and running a real BYOK audit. The
      Principal runs this in a browser and ticks the box.>

## Scope

<one-paragraph summary of the blast radius — projects touched, packages
edited, shared-package consumers affected, non-goals. End with the Tier
field on its own line:>

**Tier:** 1
```

**Field rules (read once, follow forever):**

| Field            | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                       |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Summary          | One paragraph. Closes the Issue with `Closes #<N>` somewhere in the body.                                                                                                         |
| Test plan        | Every runtime check tagged `[agent]` or `[principal]`. The brief-authoring skill makes this a **required** field — empty plans use `Test Plan: unit-tests-only` as the sentinel.   |
| `[agent]` items  | Items the Developer-agent can run end-to-end before opening the PR. Paste the **actual command output**, not a paraphrase. (This is the `[agent]` half of the Verification phase, see `state-machine.md` § Verification.) |
| `[principal]` items | Items only the Principal can run (auth-gated, vendor-key-dependent, visual). The agent **does not tick these** — the Principal does, after running in a real browser.            |
| Scope            | One paragraph + the Tier field. Ends with `**Tier:** 0 \| 1 \| 3` on its own line.                                                                                                |
| **Tier syntax**  | Exactly `Tier: 0`, `Tier: 1`, `Tier: 3` (plain) — or `**Tier:** 0`, `**Tier:** 1`, `**Tier:** 3` (bold). `Tier 1` (no colon), `Tier-1`, `Tier:1` (no space) are **rejected** by CI. |
| `Doc-ack:`       | Optional. `Doc-ack: <pointer> — <note>` — acknowledges an external (URL) binding in `.vinaya/doc-owners` that fired on this PR. `<pointer>` must exactly match the binding URL. Separator is flexible — em-dash `—`, en-dash `–`, or a plain ASCII hyphen `-` (with surrounding whitespace) are all accepted, so `Doc-ack: <pointer> - <note>` parses identically. **Body field, not a label.** (state-machine.md Section 15) |
| `vinaya/waiver:docs` (label, not a field) | Optional. A doc-coverage waiver is honored PR-wide ONLY when this label is applied AND the actor of its labeling timeline event is a configured principal — there is no body-field waiver grammar anymore; a parseable string is never sufficient. **Principal only**, applied outside any agent session. |

**What this section is NOT:** not a style guide, not exhaustive PR etiquette. It is the **contract** for the shapes `verify-docs` (C0–C5), Brief Validation, the Verification phase, and the Pre-merge gate all read. Add anything you want beneath the four sections; don't omit or reshape any of them.

---

## Documentation is part of every task

Documentation is not post-implementation optional cleanup. It is part of the task. A brief is not done until all tier-required documentation artifacts exist and pass verification. Your brief carries an explicit documentation-update list (by file name) — treat it as a DoD obligation, not a suggestion. A task that ships passing tests but incoherent docs is incomplete in the same way a task that ships with failing tests is incomplete. Every doc named in that list must be updated before opening the PR; a named doc not in the diff is a BLOCKER at review.

**Update-or-waive is a DoD gate.** Beyond that list, `verify-docs` C5 mechanically enforces code → doc coverage from `.vinaya/doc-owners`. Whenever your diff touches a code surface bound in that file, you must do exactly one of: (a) update the bound doc in the same PR; (b) for URL bindings, add a `Doc-ack: <pointer> — <note>` body field; (c) have a principal apply the actor-verified `vinaya/waiver:docs` label to the PR — you cannot self-serve this one; it is not a body field and not something you can write yourself. Doing none of these is not an option; the gate will fail CI. The seam is dormant when `.vinaya/doc-owners` is absent or no binding matches, so a PR that touches no bound surface has no obligation.

> The commands shown below are **this repo's** toolchain (Bun/JS). Substitute your repo's declared equivalents; the *obligations* (typecheck, lint, test, verify-docs) are the same everywhere.

### Tier 0 checklist

All of the following must pass before the PR is opened:

- [ ] Code passes typecheck (this repo: `bun run typecheck`)
- [ ] Code passes lint/format (this repo: `bun run format-and-lint`)
- [ ] Tests pass if applicable (this repo: `bun test`)
- [ ] PR description follows the template, carries the brief, and declares `Tier: 0`
- [ ] "Token report" section in the PR body with exact tokens from `bin/report-tokens.ts` (and again on each re-push after `CHANGES_REQUESTED`) — the Archivist appends the ledger row post-merge, you do not

### Tier 1 checklist

All Tier 0 items, plus:

- [ ] Specs updated to reflect new behavior (if new patterns introduced or existing patterns changed)
- [ ] Skills updated if conventions shifted in the area being changed
- [ ] `verify-docs --pr` passes (this is a real gate now, not a stub; this repo: `bun run verify-docs --pr`)
- [ ] `docs-index.md` updated if files were added, removed, or renamed

### Tier 3 checklist

All Tier 1 items, plus:

- [ ] State updated: the relevant per-project pinned state Issue if state changed (for every project the task lists — update operational facts, phase intent, resolved pending-manual-ops; do NOT write active-work status, which is derived from the forge) (`now.md` is retired)
- [ ] Merge happens at a ratification window (do not open the PR and expect immediate merge for Tier 3 work)

**Hard rule:** If any tier-required item fails, the PR is not ready. Do not open it. Do not say "I'll fix the doc issues after merge." Fix them before.

**Pre-PR gate (mandatory for every PR):** Before opening, run `bun packages/aeg-core/bin/verify-docs.ts --pr` locally with `PR_BODY` set to the intended PR body text — `PR_BODY="$(cat /tmp/pr-body.md)" bun packages/aeg-core/bin/verify-docs.ts --pr` — and fix any failure. Never open a PR that would fail the gate.

---

## Spike exception

If the brief is tagged `spike: true`:

- Reduced checklist: code passes typecheck + lint, with what was tried and learned recorded in the pull request
- Spike code does NOT merge to main
- After the spike, the code either rebases away (if the approach is abandoned) or converts to a Tier 1+ task in a new brief

A spike is exploratory, not a permanent excuse to skip documentation. The pull request is the durable artifact of the spike.

---

## After you open the PR — review handoff

Opening the PR is not the end. The work now enters Phase 10 review (`process.md`):

```
code-reviewer pass → security pass → Principal code review → Brief Author spec review → merge
```

The code-reviewer and security passes are **separate, fresh-context invocations** — not you. You do not review your own work; the independence is the point. What you do:

- **Address REQUEST CHANGES / FAIL findings.** A code-review BLOCKER or a security CRITICAL/HIGH comes back to you. Fix it on the **same branch** with new commits; the relevant pass re-runs. Do not open a new PR. (Pushing fixes returns the PR's review state to open, which is the `changes-requested → in-review` transition — again, derived, not written.)
- **Do not argue findings into submission.** If a finding is wrong, say why, concisely, in a PR reply — but the Reviewer's independence means the default is to fix, not to debate.
- **Do not act on an `[ESCALATE]` finding yourself.** Those route to the Planner (strategy) or Principal (`severity: product`). Wait for direction.
- **Do not merge.** Only the Principal merges.

---

## Pushback when the brief is wrong

A brief is not infallible. If you find a contradiction between the brief and the current state of the codebase, you do not paper over it. You surface it.

Escalate with the appropriate severity — a manual escalation note, or, if you were dispatched by an automation layer, its request-input mechanism:

- `severity: execution` — missing detail, deprecated dependency, flag not anticipated
- `severity: strategy` — brief assumes approach A but the codebase has gone a different direction
- `severity: product` — the brief would require a Type 1 decision not specified in the brief

The brief's stop conditions tell you when to STOP and ask. Honor them. If the stop conditions say "STOP if you discover X" and you discover X, you stop. You do not improvise a workaround.

---

## Stop conditions

Every brief includes stop conditions. Honor them unconditionally. Common reasons to STOP:

- Pre-flight checks fail (dirty tree, wrong branch, worktree could not be created cleanly, missing tools, missing reference files)
- A dispatch gate is not satisfied (a `depends-on` PR isn't merged, or a `conflicts-with` sibling's PR is open)
- Brief contradicts the current state of the codebase in a way you cannot resolve without external information
- A test fails after three genuine fix attempts — if you cannot diagnose the root cause, stop and report
- You are about to touch files outside the brief's stated scope — stop and ask first
- Any destructive action (force push, file deletion, database mutation) not explicitly authorized by the brief
- You discover a decision that should be Type 1 (irreversible) but the brief doesn't mention it

---

## What the Developer does NOT do

- **Author own briefs.** If you run out of brief, stop. Don't invent scope.
- **Write status.** Status is derived from the forge. You never edit a status field or the tranche file — opening the branch/PR and merging are the transitions.
- **Decide on contested architectural questions.** Escalate.
- **Review your own work.** The Phase 10 code-reviewer and security passes are separate fresh-context invocations. Do not self-approve.
- **Merge PRs.** Open the PR; the Principal merges.
- **Modify files outside the brief's stated scope** without asking first. Adjacent cleanups, "while I'm here" improvements — all of these require escalation.
- **Skip verification hooks** (e.g. `--no-verify`) unless the brief explicitly authorizes it with a reason.
- **Skip permission prompts** (e.g. a "dangerously skip permissions" flag) unless the brief authorizes it.
- **Modify another Developer's in-progress worktree.** Each task has its own worktree; cross-worktree changes create conflicts that are hard to untangle.
- **Commit a new file whose sole purpose is a report, finding, or audit summary.** A one-off deliverable — a coverage report, an audit result, a findings writeup — goes in the PR body or an Issue/PR comment, never a new repo file. This has already broken AEG Studio once (a committed audit deliverable was silently parsed as a broken tranche by the Studio loader).

---

## Worktree discipline

When dispatched by an automation layer, you work in the worktree it created at `.worktrees/task/<tranche>/<n>/` on branch `task/<tranche>/<n>` — your isolated workspace, branched from `origin/main`.

When working manually, the brief's pre-flight Step 0 gives you the worktree command. Run it first:
- `git worktree add .worktrees/task/<tranche>/<n> -b task/<tranche>/<n> origin/main && cd .worktrees/task/<tranche>/<n>`
- Then `git worktree list` to confirm you're not accidentally working in another task's worktree
- Branch from `origin/main`, never from `HEAD` of the current local checkout (which may be behind)
- Confirm the branch was created correctly: `git log --oneline -3` should show the expected parent

The `task/<tranche>/<n>` branch name is the convention that lets any role find this task's branch and PR (and therefore its derived status) with one forge query. Use it exactly.

After every commit: `git log --oneline -3` to confirm the new commit is a direct child of the expected parent. A mixed reset between sessions can leave HEAD at an older ancestor silently — the only reliable check is ancestry verification.

**Stash is off-limits in a shared-repo worktree.** Never `git stash` while working in `.worktrees/task/<tranche>/<n>/`. Stash refs are global across every worktree of a shared repo clone — a stray `stash pop` run in one task's worktree can pop a *different* task's in-progress stash, silently corrupting its uncommitted work. This is not hypothetical: a near-miss surfaced live on a task branch's own PR. If you need to set aside in-progress changes, commit a WIP commit on your own branch instead (`git commit -m "Chore: WIP checkpoint"` — amend or squash it away before opening the PR) — a commit is branch-scoped and cannot collide with another worktree.

---

## Commit conventions

- Format: `Type(scope): Brief description` — start-case type, optional lower-case scope in parens, colon, space, description
- Types: `Feat`, `Fix`, `Refactor`, `Style`, `Docs`, `Chore`, `Test`, `Perf`, `Build`, `Revert`
- **Header line MUST be ≤72 characters** (type + scope + description combined). Count before committing: `echo -n "Feat(scope): your message here" | wc -c`. CI rejects anything over 72 — this is the single most common CI failure.
- Scope must be lower-case, naming the surface touched (e.g. `ui`, `api`, `cli`)
- Subject must be sentence-case (not ALL CAPS, not all lowercase)
- No trailing period on the subject line
- Reference the task's Issue in the PR body (`Closes #N`), not necessarily in every commit message
- Do not include agent self-attribution / "generated by" trailers in commit messages
- Never skip verification hooks on commits unless the brief explicitly authorizes it

## When to escalate

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Brief contradicts codebase reality | Escalate, severity: execution |
| Architectural choice not specified in brief | Escalate, severity: strategy |
| Scope expansion feels warranted ("while I'm here...") | STOP — ask before touching anything outside scope |
| Pre-commit hook fails | Fix the underlying issue — do not bypass |
| Test fails after three genuine diagnosis attempts | STOP — report what you tried and what the failure is |
| Type 1 decision discovered during execution | Escalate, severity: product |
| A dispatch gate isn't satisfied | STOP — the task serializes behind its dependency/conflict |
| `pre-push` prints a C5 doc-owners warning on a branch's **first** push (no PR open yet) | NOT an escalation — the push always succeeds (ring 0 is warn-only, never a hard block). If the doc is genuinely stale, update it in this branch. If you believe it genuinely does not need updating, say so in the PR body when you open the PR and note that ring 1 will stay red until a principal applies the `vinaya/waiver:docs` label — you cannot self-serve this waiver (the earlier commit-trailer self-service is superseded; there is no body-field waiver grammar anymore). Escalate to the Principal only if you are unsure whether the doc is actually stale. |

## Verification before reporting done

Before you say you are done or open a PR, run all of the following (substitute your repo's toolchain commands — shown here in this repo's Bun/JS form). Paste the actual output when reporting — not a summary.

0. **Commit message length** — for every commit on this branch: `git log origin/main..HEAD --format="%s" | awk '{ if (length > 72) print NR": "length" chars (OVER LIMIT): "$0 }'` — must return nothing. If any commit header exceeds 72 chars, amend it before opening the PR.
1. `typecheck` (this repo: `bun run typecheck`) — paste the result line ("X successful, X total" or the error)
2. `lint/format` (this repo: `bun run format-and-lint`) — paste "No fixes applied" or the violations
3. `test` (this repo: `bun test`) — paste "X pass, 0 fail" or the failures
4. `verify-docs --pr` (this repo: `bun run verify-docs --pr`) — paste the result (real gate now — pass, or the specific failure to fix)
5. `git status` — must be clean (everything committed) or explain what's uncommitted and why
6. `git log --oneline -3` — confirm commit ancestry is correct (new commit is direct child of expected parent)
7. `git diff main --stat` — paste the full change list; confirm only expected files changed

If any of these fail: fix the failure, then re-verify. Do not report done until all pass. Do not say "tests pass" without running the test command and seeing the output.

Items 1–4 are also composed into one command, `bun packages/aeg-core/bin/verify-task.ts` (plus a build step and the premise coverage/recheck pair) — **`open-pr.ts` now runs this composite itself** for task branches (task 25), so it also runs mechanically at PR-open time. Running it yourself first remains the cheaper, earlier catch.

## Verification — the phase between review and merge

The checks above are **static**: they prove the change compiles, lints, types and matches its declared surface. They do not prove the feature works. Verification is the separate, mandatory phase that runs the brief's Test Plan against a booted app, after the review passes and before the Principal merges.

**It is a phase, not an actor.** There is no Verifier to dispatch. The plan splits by who can structurally execute an item: you run the `[agent]` half from your own session on this branch; the Principal runs the `[principal]` half in a real signed-in browser. Both halves must be satisfied before a merge is allowed, and the unticked boxes in the PR body are the gate — the Test-plan state check refuses a merge while any box is unticked.

**Why it exists:** four consecutive features once merged with green CI and were broken at runtime — a missing migration, a missing environment variable, a missing provider, an unexecuted test plan. The static gates ran and passed; the reviews read the diff; nobody booted the app. Verification is the phase that closes that gap.

### Refuse if it isn't your turn

- **No open PR** — nothing to verify; come back when one is open.
- **No brief in the PR body** — without a Test Plan there is no definition of "verified"; paste the brief first.
- **No Test Plan section in the brief** — the brief is malformed; flag it for correction and stop rather than inventing a plan at verification time.
- **The plan declares `unit-tests-only` but the diff touches a runtime surface** (a route, a page, a server action) — the brief was mis-declared; flag it for correction. This is the failsafe against quietly downgrading verification.

If the brief declares `unit-tests-only` and the diff really is pure logic, the phase is satisfied by the unit-test gate; record that as the outcome.

### The `[agent]` half — yours

1. **Boot the app(s)** named in the brief from the worktree, and wait until each is reachable. If it does not boot, that is the failure — the plan never gets a chance to run.
2. **Execute every `[agent]` item.** Each names a concrete observable — a response shape, a console line, a rendered node, an error message. Run the named command and **paste the actual output**. Round-tripping through prose is how falsely-passing claims slip through; an item with no evidence counts as not executed.
3. **Report on the PR** — each item with its result and its evidence.
4. **Stop there.** Do not execute `[principal]` items; you structurally cannot. Mark them as awaiting the Principal.

A failed `[agent]` item makes the PR unmergeable. Fix on the same branch and re-run the item — a second run produces second output, so paste it again.

### The `[principal]` half — not yours

The Principal executes the auth-gated, key-dependent and visual items in a browser and ticks those boxes. Never tick one because the `[agent]` items passed: they prove different properties. Never re-tag a `[principal]` item as `[agent]` to complete your half — that asymmetry is the whole point of the split, and erasing it is the failure this phase exists to prevent.

### What this phase does not do

It does not edit code (failures go back to you as the Developer), does not author tests (the plan comes from the brief), does not merge (only the Principal does), does not write status anywhere, and does not replace the code review or the security pass — a change can pass both and still be broken at runtime.

## Pre-merge gate

Before any merge-adjacent action (commenting "MERGE", helping the Principal merge, or pushing a "fix CI" commit after review), run this check on the open PR. If any item fails, post a comment on the PR listing exactly what's missing, and **block and report** — do not proceed with any merge-adjacent action.

The check is tool-agnostic — "reviewer approved" means any reviewer with `state: APPROVED`, whether human, @claude GitHub App, or another agent.

**Tool:** `gh pr view <n> --json reviews,statusCheckRollup,body`

**Check items (all three must pass):**

1. **Reviewer approved?** The JSON `reviews` array contains at least one entry with `state: APPROVED`.
2. **Test Plan items ticked?** The PR body's Test Plan section contains no unchecked `- [ ] **[agent]**` lines.
3. **Principal confirmation?** The PR body's Test Plan section contains no unchecked `- [ ] **[principal]**` lines.

If any fails: post a comment listing the exact items missing, and STOP. The Principal decides what to do next.

## Anti-patterns

These are failures the Developer must actively avoid. Several come from real incidents.

**Trusting your own self-report without diff inspection.** Run `git diff main --stat` and read it before reporting done.

**Reviewing your own work instead of handing off.** The code-reviewer and security passes are separate invocations for a reason — fresh eyes catch what the author's context hides.

**Writing status into a file "for convenience."** Status is derived from the forge. Editing the tranche file to record state recreates the racing status store the model eliminated. Never do it.

**Fallback approaches without proving the preferred approach is impossible.** If the brief says "use Library X," you must demonstrate X is impossible before switching to Y. Don't silently choose Y because it was easier.

**Editing docs to match broken implementations.** The implementation is broken; the doc is correct. Fix the implementation.

**Force-pushing without verifying merge will work.** Test with `git merge --dry-run` or open the PR first to see if there are conflicts.

**Pre-push verification that omits production build.** A dev-mode typecheck can pass while the production build fails under stricter resolution (e.g. a frozen-lockfile install). Run the production build too, where the repo has one.

**Adding "small improvements" outside scope.** "While I'm here, I'll clean this up." Stop. That's scope creep. Finish the brief, open the PR, create a new Issue for the cleanup.

**Closing the PR before running the Task Done checklist.** The checklist is not a formality. Run it; paste the output.

**Reporting "all green" when you ran a subset of checks.** If you ran typecheck but not tests, say so. Don't round up. Partial verification plus a confident summary is how bugs reach main.

**Fabricating verification output.** This has happened. Run the actual command; paste the actual output. If the output is long, paste the relevant portion and indicate you've elided the rest. Do not paraphrase verification results.

**Marking items complete on a checklist without verification evidence.** A check means you ran the command and saw the expected output — not that you believe it should pass.

**Starting on the wrong branch.** Check `git branch` and `git log --oneline -3` before writing any code. Fix the branch before proceeding.

**Starting before the gates are clear.** Check that dependencies are merged and no conflicting PR is open before the first commit — not after you've done the work.
