### Minor Changes

- dae964d: **⚠️ BREAKING BEHAVIOUR CHANGE — `vinaya check` now executes what the resolver decides. Read this before upgrading: a `vinaya.config.json` that worked yesterday can refuse to run anything today.**
  
  `vinaya check`'s execution moves off the flat `core + config` concat and onto the resolver that has fed `vinaya check --plan` since 0.9.0. Three behaviour changes land together:
  
  1. **Replace semantics.** A `checks` key that exactly matches a core check id now **REPLACES** that core check. Previously both ran — the core one and yours, under the same name, producing two conclusions. The core check no longer runs at all.
  
  2. **Namespace rejection.** A bare, un-namespaced key that matches no core check id is now **REJECTED**. Every non-override key must be `<yourname>/<id>`, with both segments matching `[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*` and `vinaya` reserved as a prefix. **Adding a prefix is not always enough:** if the bare name itself breaks that grammar — `my_check` (underscore), `QALint` (uppercase) — it still breaks it after prefixing, and needs a real rename.
  
  3. **`FAIL_CLOSED` is live.** A malformed `checks` entry or a rejected bare key now makes the whole run **refuse**: exit 1, loud, with **nothing executed**. Before this release, an invalid config still ran the core checks; after it, nothing runs. There is no `--skip-broken` escape hatch and no core-only fallback — a partially-applied ruleset that still prints green is exactly what this refuses to produce.
  
  **This can break an adopter's CI.** That is intended — an invalid registration silently running a subset of your gates is the failure mode being closed — but it means the upgrade is not a no-op for any repo whose `checks` block is not already clean.
  
  **Before upgrading, run `vinaya check --plan` on 0.9.0.** It prints the exact resolution this release executes: every `FAIL_CLOSED` row it shows is a run that will now refuse, and every `overridden` row is a core check that will now stop running. `--plan` and execution read the same resolution, so what the plan prints is what runs.
  
  **Diagnosing a refused config.** The two grace-period warnings 0.9.0 printed from `vinaya check` are gone from check output — a refused run prints its refusal instead. They live on permanently as `vinaya doctor` diagnostics: the override class at `warn`, the rejected-bare-key class at `error`, naming the rename requirement. A config that now runs nothing is still fully diagnosable through `vinaya doctor`.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 264a8ae: The repo-wide coherence sweep stops re-fetching forge data it already holds. `verify-coherence.ts`'s `loadTrancheFiles` derived each tranche independently, so a repo with N Milestones paid N re-pulls of the entire Milestone list plus N serial `gh issue list` calls, and L4/L5 then re-issued those same N Issue queries a second time for the `milestone` field a `Tranche` drops. The sweep now enumerates every tranche first, indexes Milestones once (`indexTrancheMilestonesAsync`), fetches each tranche's labeled Issues exactly once at a bounded concurrency of 4, and derives both the task list and L4's Milestone-attachment facts from that single response. Measured against `atta-labs/vinaya` (6 Milestones): 21 `gh` calls and 26.4 s become 7 and 9.5 s, with byte-identical report JSON — the derivation, the checks, and the verdict are unchanged, only the round trips are gone. New `@attalabs/aeg-forge-state` exports for callers that hold forge data already: `indexTrancheMilestonesAsync`, `fetchTrancheIssuesAsync`, `trancheFromIssues`, `tasksFromIssues`, `issueMilestonesFromIssues`, and the `TrancheMilestoneIndex`/`GhIssue` types. Every existing export keeps its signature and behaviour. `indexTrancheMilestonesAsync` is paginated via the new `ghApiGetAllPagesAsync`: Milestones are append-only, so the single `per_page=100` page the older readers use is a countdown rather than a bound, and silent truncation in the index a repo-wide sweep enumerates from would drop tranches from every check with no error. The sweep also keys its Milestone fill-in on which tranches were actually produced rather than which were enumerated, so a PR that deletes or archives a topology file can no longer narrow the sweep — the deletion case fell through to a forge derivation as before, and an archival move (`tranches/x.md` to `tranches/completed/x.md`) keeps the PR head's own content and its `archived` flag. Forge unavailability is reported rather than thrown or absorbed, on every path: a lost Milestone index refuses the run when nothing local can be enumerated, and withholds L4/L5 — whose only active-tranche authority it is — when topology files keep the sweep non-empty, rather than letting an empty authority read as "no drift"; a per-tranche read that fails with no file to stand in names the omitted slugs. `ghApiGetAllPagesAsync` sets `per_page` itself rather than trusting the caller's path, because the page size IS its stop condition, and refuses to walk past a page ceiling instead of looping without bound. The sweep's two git readers now spawn `git` with an argv array rather than interpolating a ref and a path into a shell string: one of those paths is assembled from a Milestone title, so through a shell a title carrying a command substitution executed, while as one argv element it is only a filename git fails to resolve — which both readers already treat as absent.

### Patch Changes

- 6e3cf0f: The four generated workflows now invoke `npx --yes @attalabs/vinaya@<exact-installed-version>`, the same exact-version pin the generated git hooks already carried and from the same source (`ownVersion()`). Previously they emitted a bare `npx --yes @attalabs/vinaya`, which reads as "always latest" and is not: where `vinaya-checks.yml` carries an install step — which it does only when the adopter declares `ci.setup` — a repo carrying the CLI as a devDependency resolved `node_modules/.bin/vinaya` instead of the registry, measured as `0.8.2` inside such an adopter repo against `0.9.0` in `/tmp`. There, CI's version was an accident of a dependency no workflow referenced, and changing that dependency moved CI to registry latest with no commit and no diff. An adopter declaring no `ci.setup` gets no install step at all, so for them a bare spec resolved registry latest in all four workflows. The generated workflows are managed artifacts, so `vinaya upgrade` rewrites an existing install's unpinned workflows to the pinned shape and re-pins them on each version bump; `vinaya doctor` reports a stale pin as drift. The git hooks are unchanged.
- 32a01e2: The shipped token-report doctrine no longer names a host tool's script as the requirement. `aeg-root/tranche-model.md` §12 now states the obligation as three layers — every role reports its own turn's usage (portable), collected by whatever means its host offers (host-specific), into the `Tokens: …` grammar in the artifact its turn produced (portable) — so an adopter on any harness implements only the middle layer and inherits the rest unchanged. The role docs (`developer.md`, `archivist.md`, `planner.md`, `reviewer.md`, `security.md`, `tranche-archivist.md`), `state-machine.md` and `enforcement.md`'s registry row now cite `bin/report-tokens.ts` as *the Claude Code way* to satisfy collection rather than as the rule. The taxonomy that split roles by Anthropic product name ("terminal roles run in Claude Code" vs "claude.ai roles run in chat") is replaced by the capability it was actually describing: **self-metering** (the host exposes the session's own usage to the agent) vs **operator-metered** (it does not), both defined in `glossary.md`. Per-cell `—` optionality is now conditioned on that host capability rather than on the role, and `state-machine.md`'s stale, already-retracted `(terminal: /cost)` claim is gone.
  
  The obligation itself is unchanged and is not weakened: reporting stays mandatory, `—` stays sanctioned only where a host exposes no usage to the agent at all, and the no-estimate rules carry forward in substance, restated as one capability-conditioned rule rather than two role-specific ones.
  
  `@attalabs/aeg-core` gains `src/claude-code-transcript.ts`, which now homes `summarizeTranscript` — it parses one vendor's transcript JSONL and its `usage` field names, so it was never portable despite living beside the portable renderers. `TranscriptSummary` is now documented as the adapter seam: an adapter's whole contract is to produce that shape, and everything downstream of it (`formatTokensLine`, `parse-token-report.ts`'s grammar) is shared by every host. No exported name, type or behaviour changes — `summarizeTranscript` is still exported from the package root. `bin/report-tokens.ts` gains a declared `--transcript <path>` flag (previously reachable only by accident, as a bare positional) and reframes its missing-pointer error: naming your own transcript is a supported primary route, and a repo that installs no `track-transcript.sh` Stop hook — this one included — is not misconfigured for lacking a pointer file.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 7d939d8: `vinaya studio` now launches for real in a published install. `bundle-studio.ts` fetches attalabs' CI-built standalone Studio bundle from its public release artifact (`atta-labs/attalabs`'s `vinaya-studio-artifact.yml` workflow, no token required) and assembles it into `studio-standalone/` at `prepack` time, instead of requiring a Studio source tree this repository never had. The default ports move from `3006`/`3106` (the retired `apps/vinaya/web`'s ports) to `3008`/`3108` (matching `apps/vinaya-studio/web`'s own docs). `packages/sources/src/commands.ts`'s `studio` row and `verify-published-lifecycle.ts`'s `studio` exercise both now describe and assert a real launch instead of the prior honest refusal.

## 0.8.2

### Patch Changes

- 9d730e1: Fix the `doc-coverage` check so an applied `vinaya/waiver:docs` label actually takes effect. It previously read `PR_LABELS`/`WAIVER_LABEL_ACTOR` from the environment, expecting the CI workflow to inject them — but no generated `vinaya-checks.yml`, old or current, ever set either var, so the waiver path was silently unreachable in every adopter's CI (caught live on atta-labs/attalabs#948). The check now resolves the label and its labeling actor live via `gh`, from `PR_NUMBER`, the same way `review-gate` already does — no workflow template change needed, and every already-generated `vinaya-checks.yml` is fixed in place.

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- 30dc300: Recognize a hand-closed dependency Issue as valid when it was closed directly by a recognized Principal identity (verified via GitHub's own `ClosedEvent` actor, not claimed in prose), instead of only accepting a merged closing PR. `dispatch-gate` and `coherence` check A1 both gain this second, narrower recognition path — the default merged-PR path is unchanged.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 9cfa0c7: Recover the `vinaya studio` command the extraction dropped.
  
  Four files (`commands/studio.ts`, `lib/studio-bundle.ts`, `scripts/bundle-studio.ts`, `tests/studio.test.ts`) lived at `apps/vinaya/cli/**` in the attalabs monorepo. The extraction moved the CLI to this repository without them, and attalabs then deleted the directory they were in — the command survived only in that repo's history, absent from both repos, the router, and the published tarball, with no gate noticing.
  
  They are recovered here against the two-repo reality: Studio's source (`apps/vinaya/web`) stayed in attalabs, so the workspace branch of `resolveStudioTarget` serves only checkouts that carry that tree, and no published build bundles the standalone Studio app. Rather than fixing import paths and shipping a command that resolves nothing, the recovered command refuses explicitly (exit 1, message naming the package) in every shape it cannot yet serve. `bundle-studio.ts` is recovered as pack-shape knowledge but deliberately not wired into `prepack` or the `files` allowlist — producing and shipping the bundle is the separate Studio-packaging task, so the published artifact's contents are unchanged.
  
  `@atta/vinaya-sources` gains the matching `studio` row in the `COMMANDS` registry, with an honest description of what the command does and does not yet do; `verify-published-lifecycle.ts` exercises the refusal for real against the packed artifact.

## 0.7.1

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- a0d413a: Adopter-declared CI setup: a new optional `ci.setup` key in `vinaya.config.json`, emitted verbatim as an "Adopter CI setup" step in the generated workflows that execute `vinaya check` (checks, review, review-verdict — never the archivist, whose jobs spawn no adopter code).
  
  The generated jobs previously installed node and nothing else — correct for vinaya's own checks, which arrive whole via `npx`, and fatal for an adopter's custom checks, which are scripts in the adopter's own repository that may import the adopter's own code. Measured on the first non-greenfield adopter: both of its custom checks failed as `error (2ms)` spawn failures on every CI run while passing in the local hooks, turning a required check permanently red.
  
  The command is declared in the committed config, never inferred — vinaya cannot know an adopter's package manager or runtime. When the key is absent, the generated workflows are byte-identical to before it existed, so existing installs see no churn. Note for repos that do declare it: the generated workflows are managed artifacts, so the next `vinaya upgrade` after declaring the key rewrites their bytes — that is the intended delivery path, not drift.
  
  `@atta/vinaya-sources` gains the matching `ci` / `ci.setup` rows in the adopter-facing config reference.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 7d074ac: Add `vinaya doctrine` — prints the absolute path of the bundled doctrine's front door (`aeg-root/skills/aeg/SKILL.md`), resolved at read time on the caller's own machine (`--json` for the enveloped `{ root, entry }` form) — and make the committed `VINAYA.md` doctrine pointer machine-independent: it now names the `@attalabs/vinaya` package and hands the reader that command, instead of interpolating the installing machine's absolute install path into committed content. The old shape broke for every clone but the installer's (and for the installer on their next upgrade, since npx's cache key rotates with the version), published the installing user's home directory into the repo, and made `doctor` report drift on every machine except the one that ran `init`. Existing adopters see one-time managed-file drift on `VINAYA.md` at their next `doctor`, and a rewrite on their next `upgrade` — the drift being reported is the machine-local path this release removes.
- edd7c17: Ring 0 now survives a clone (atta-labs/attalabs#927). Non-husky installs write git hooks into a TRACKED `.vinaya/hooks/` directory routed via `git config core.hooksPath .vinaya/hooks` instead of the unversioned `.git/hooks` — hook files travel with the repo into every clone and every linked worktree checkout, where before a fresh clone silently had zero ring-0 enforcement while the manifest still claimed the hooks existed.
  
  What changes for adopters:
  
  - **New installs** (`vinaya init`, no husky, no active raw `.git/hooks` hooks): hooks land in `.vinaya/hooks/` (commit them) and the installing clone is armed automatically. Each FRESH clone runs `git config core.hooksPath .vinaya/hooks` once — the one thing git cannot version. `vinaya doctor` reports an unarmed clone as an error and names that exact command; `vinaya upgrade` also arms it.
  - **Existing `.git/hooks` installs**: the next `vinaya upgrade` migrates — tracked copies land first, legacy hosts are stripped, the config is armed, and the manifest's hook paths are rewritten. The migration REFUSES (and says why, and `doctor` keeps warning) whenever arming would silently disable hooks vinaya does not own: adopter lines in a hook host, or any unmanaged active raw hook in `.git/hooks`.
  - **Husky installs**: unchanged.
  - **`vinaya eject`**: also unsets `core.hooksPath` when it still points at vinaya's own tracked dir.
  - The managed-manifest version bumps 1 → 2 (shape unchanged) so an older package meeting a migrated manifest refuses loudly instead of half-understanding the recorded hook locations.

### Patch Changes

- 562408b: Name the failing check on the run's Summary page of the generated Vinaya Checks workflow.
  
  The workflow's one aggregate check reports only "vinaya check --all --diff-only: failing" — it never says which of the registered checks failed, forcing a trip into the raw log. The generated job now tees the runner's per-check stdout (the `✓/·/✗ name: status` lines plus each finding's message) into a file, and a follow-up step appends it, fenced, to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`.
  
  Two guards are load-bearing: `set -o pipefail` before the tee, because the job's default shell is `bash -e` without pipefail and an unguarded pipe would report a red suite green; and the summary step runs on `!cancelled()` rather than `always()`, because the concurrency group cancels superseded runs routinely and their half-captured output is noise. Both the published (`npx`) and vendored (`node <bin>`) shapes get the same capture.
- e3379ee: Correct `aeg-root/enforcement.md`'s ring-table implementation pointers to the mechanisms that actually run in a vinaya-governed repo — the managed `.git/hooks/pre-commit`/`pre-push` blocks, the validated `vinaya issue|pr` forge-write commands, the required review-gate check, and the `vinaya-*.yml` workflows — instead of the attalabs-only `.husky/*`, `.claude/hooks/*`, and `forge-lifecycle.yml` paths, which do not exist in an adopter repo (measured live by the `registry-gates` G1 check during the first tranche cut natively in atta-labs/vinaya). `aeg-root/` ships in the published tarball, so the stale pointers were the account every adopter got.
  
  Also records, in `apps/cli/specs/self-hosting.md` (unpublished), what that first forge-native walk measured: the authoring-time vs CI brief-shape divergence, the file-topology phrasing still present in some refusal text and baselines, and the Planner-surface gap (no CLI path for Milestone or tranche-label creation).
- 9fde689: Fix `vinaya upgrade` crashing (`ENOTDIR`) when run from inside a linked git worktree (atta-labs/attalabs#942) — it now resolves git-hook paths through `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`, the same fix `vinaya doctor` already had, lifted into a shared resolver both (and `init`, `quickstart`, `demo break`) now call.
  
  Every AEG-style adopter that develops in linked worktrees hit this: a worktree's `.git` is a gitlink file, not a directory, so the old `join(repoRoot, '.git/hooks/…')` tried to `mkdir` under a file and aborted the whole upgrade before any other managed artifact (e.g. the doctrine pointer) was written. Hooks are never actually per-worktree — every linked worktree shares the primary checkout's hooks directory — so the fix resolves the real shared path instead of guessing wrong and crashing.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- d4a12db: Remove the `vinaya studio` command and its bundled Studio assets from the published CLI.
  
  `studio` was a documented command in the README's command table. An adopter
  running it after upgrading now gets an unknown command — that is a breaking
  change for anyone using it, not an internal cleanup. The published tarball
  also shrinks from ~85.7 MB to ~743 kB as a direct result. Bumped `minor`
  rather than `patch`: pre-1.0 semver convention treats `minor` as the
  breaking-change slot, and a silent `patch` would misrepresent the removal's
  impact.
  
  Also bundled in this release, since none of it has been published yet:
  
  - Fix: resolve the vendored CLI correctly in generated git hooks
  - Fix: address code-review findings from the Studio-removal PR
  - Fix: make the reader-facing no-op sentinel structurally safe
  - Feat: add Changesets with a fixed-group cascade (the mechanism that
    produced this release)
