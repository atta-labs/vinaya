// bundled file to the package root differs, and a fixed walk landed every

// once at module scope: the package root a check's bin resolves against
// never changes at runtime.

/**
 * The four core AEG gates an adopter's repo actually runs, expressed as
 * ordinary `CheckSpec`s — the exact shape a `vinaya.config.json` entry
 * produces. No extra field, no privileged flag: this IS the
 * no-privileged-API proof, not a stylistic choice. See
 * `tests/checks/no-privileged-api.test.ts`.
 *
 * `reader-resolvable-prose` is NOT registered here: it hardcodes this
 * monorepo's own doctrine layout
 * (`aeg-root/glossary.md`, `aeg-root/tranches/completed/`) and this
 * monorepo's own marketing-site source path
 * (`apps/vinaya/web/src/app/(site)/**\/page.tsx`) — a scope-registration bug,
 * not a pathing one. No `packageRoot()`-style fix makes those paths exist in
 * an arbitrary adopter's repo. The check's bin and its underlying
 * `@atta/aeg-core` logic are left in place — they may still be useful as this
 * repo's own internal doc-quality tool — but they are reachable only by
 * direct invocation, never through this adopter-facing registry.
