/** Spawns the bundled standalone Studio server. `cwd` is the CALLER's own
 *  cwd (the guest repo), not `packageDir` — `server.js`'s own require/asset
 *  resolution is relative to its own file location (verified live: it
 *  serves correctly from an unrelated cwd).
 *
 *  That cwd-independence does NOT extend to the APP's own runtime repo-root
 *  reads, though — Next's generated `server.js` does `process.chdir(__dirname)`
 *  as its own first line (confirmed live, every standalone build), so by the
 *  time app code calls `resolveRepo()` the process cwd is back on the
 *  installed package, not the guest repo, and a plain `git remote get-url
 *  origin` there fails with "not a git repository". `AEG_REPO` is
 *  `resolveRepo()`'s own documented override (checked before it falls back to
 *  the git lookup) — resolving it HERE, before the chdir happens, and forcing
 *  it into the child's env is what makes the chdir harmless. This is the one
 *  thing standing between this task and the exact manual "AEG_REPO env var
 *  trick" workaround the Issue names as what package mode should retire; an
 *  explicit `AEG_REPO` the caller already set is preserved (`resolveRepo`
 *  checks it first internally, so this never overrides a real override).
 *
 *  `HOSTNAME` is forced to loopback-only (`127.0.0.1`) unless the caller's
 *  own environment already sets it. The bundled `server.js` reads
 *  `process.env.HOSTNAME || '0.0.0.0'` — unset, it binds every interface,
 *  which for `next dev` inside this monorepo is a pre-existing, narrow
 *  exposure (only reachable by someone who already has this checkout and
 *  runs it themselves). Shipping the *package* branch on the public npm
 *  registry is a different exposure: it turns the same unauthenticated
 *  bind into a default for any `npx @attalabs/vinaya studio` invocation,
 *  in any adopter's repo, reachable by anything else on the same network
 *  for the life of the process, serving that repo's real forge-derived
 *  tranche/task data with no auth (security review, PR #855). Loopback-only
 *  is the safe default; an operator who genuinely wants LAN access can
 *  still set `HOSTNAME` themselves.
 *
 *  `VINAYA_REPO_ROOT` closes the gap the paragraph above flags but doesn't
 *  fix: `AEG_REPO` only survives the chdir for git-remote/GitHub-API reads
 *  (`resolveRepo()`). The app's FILE-based repo-root walks — `.vinaya/
 *  projects.md` (`web/src/lib/repo-state/read-root.ts`), `vinaya.config.json`
 *  (`web/src/lib/github-links.ts`), and `aeg-root/` (`web/src/lib/docs/
 *  load-aeg-docs.ts`) — all default to a bare `process.cwd()` walk with no
 *  override, so they silently resolved the installed package's own tree
 *  post-chdir and returned empty/missing state (found live: Projects showed
 *  "No projects registered" despite a real `.vinaya/projects.md` existing).
 *  Same fix shape as `AEG_REPO`: capture `cwd` here, before the chdir,
 *  force it into the child's env. */
