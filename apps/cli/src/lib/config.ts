 *
 *   1. `loadConfig()` — read the PR's own working tree. A PR added its author
 *      to `principals` and self-approved.
 *   2. `git show ${BASE_SHA}:...` — `BASE_SHA` was an env var, and a
 *      `pull_request`-triggered workflow runs the PR's OWN copy of the
 *      workflow YAML, so the PR set `BASE_SHA` to its own head SHA.
 *   3. `git show origin/main:...` with a hardcoded ref — but `origin/main` is
 *      a LOCAL remote-tracking ref inside the job's own disk, and the PR's own
 *      workflow YAML can run `git update-ref refs/remotes/origin/main HEAD`
 *      before this check's step. Reproduced live; the doc comment claiming
 *      "only push access to `main` can move it" conflated that local ref with
 *      the real protected branch on GitHub.
 *
 * The lesson those three share: **inside a `pull_request`-triggered workflow,
 * NOTHING reachable from the job's own filesystem or environment is a trust
 * boundary against the PR author** — the workflow definition itself comes
 * from the PR. So the config CONTENT is read from **GitHub's API**, which
 * serves the repository's default-branch bytes from server-side state the PR
 * cannot touch, rather than from local git or the working tree.
 *
 * **Precisely scoped claim, because the previous two rounds were undone by
 * overclaiming:** the CONTENT is server-side; the repository IDENTITY used to
 * address that API call still comes from `trustAnchorRepo()`, which reads
 * `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` (set by the Actions runner) and falls back to the
 * `origin` remote URL. Both are PR-influenceable in principle. That is
 * deliberate and not a practical lever: where a PR controls the workflow YAML
 * it already holds a strictly stronger primitive (delete the step entirely),
 * and where the YAML is trusted the runner sets `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` correctly
 * so the remote fallback is never reached. The precedence order is therefore
 * load-bearing — runner value first, remote only as a local-dev fallback —
 * and must not be reordered.
 *
 * **This raises the bar; it is not, by itself, the boundary.** A PR can still
 * edit its own copy of the generated workflow to delete this step, `exit 0`,
 * or otherwise not run the gate at all. The thing that actually makes review
 * enforcement unbypassable is **GitHub branch protection with this check
 * marked as a required status check** — a required check that never reports
 * leaves the PR unmergeable, and that rule lives in repository settings,
 * outside any PR's reach. `vinaya init` prints the branch-protection
 * recommendation and `vinaya doctor` reports when it is missing; an adopter
 * setting `principals` without branch protection has a useful convention, not
 * a security control, and the docs must never imply otherwise.
